Led by XLerateHealth, LLC, an SBA award-winning healthcare-focused technology accelerator, the Hub will 1) bridge the divide between great ideas and the marketplace by leveraging and connecting existing resources and unique expertise assets across all participating entities in the Southeast IDeA state region, 2) fill the gaps that constitute barriers to efficient commercialization among partner institutions, and 3) deliver the necessary resources, education, and business networks to foster and sustain a culture of entrepreneurship across the region. This project will address significant disparities and lack of access to resources, talent, and capital in respective local commercialization ecosystems for biomedical technologies that are pervasive across the Southeast IDeA state region, making the rates of technology transfer and commercialization of academic research discoveries in this region suboptimal. The Hub objectives/ core functions are: 1. To improve knowledge and understanding by innovators about how technologies are brought to market. 2. To improve knowledge and understanding by accelerators and technology transfer offices about the unique commercialization pathways of various biomedical technologies 3. To facilitate access to technology/product development and commercialization resources required for early-stage technology advancement and later-stage product development 4. To help close the gap(s) in funding (a) between basic research discoveries and scientific proof of feasibility, and (b) between exhaustion of grant funding and private capital required to generate products and revenues. 5. To commercialize innovation in pharmaceuticals, medical devices, healthcare IT and electronics, and other biomedical technologies through entrepreneurship, licensing, and partnerships with established companies, and additionally commercialize the Hub's platform, programs, and materials through access by other regions.

1712365,Idaho,"ASCEND, Accelerating Solutions for Commercialization and Entrepreneurial Development in the Mountain West IDeA States",,,,,,https://ascendhub.org/,"The objective of this proposal is to create a Mountain West region technology Accelerator Hub to conduct research on developing, implementing, and testing a comprehensive collateral and consulting offering for promoting biomedical entrepreneurship, technology transfer, management, small business finance, and additional business skills needed to commercialize basic research to enhance human health. Many limiting factors hamper the ultimate goal of commercializing basic and translational science in IDeA states, including a gap in funding between basic research discoveries and scientific feasibility or validation studies required to define a product for early stage technology development, a lack of knowledge and understanding by innovators about how technologies are brought to market, a lack of access to sufficient technology development and commercialization resources for early-stage technology development, limited resources in Technology Transfer and Commercialization Offices, an insufficient number of local technology businesses to create a critical mass of entrepreneurial expertise and culture; a lack of exposure to commercialization education, training, and mentoring (including in patents, startups, business plans, venture capital and angel investing), a limited knowledge of technology transfer and SBIR/STTR programs; and a lack of awareness of available resources at the local, state and regional levels. To address these goals, we propose to create a regional technology Accelerator Hub throughout the Mountain West (Western) region of IDeA states that is closely networked with Mountain West IDeA state universities and their affiliated Technology Transfer Offices and small business partners. This network will provide the framework for effective communication and outreach that will create institutional change and build an entrepreneurial culture throughout this region. We will provide robust education and training of students and researchers and other entrepreneurs to accelerate development of commercialization activities, substantially increasing SBIR/STTR applications and facilitating communication between the NIH and IDeA institutions. The objectives of this application are to: 1) establish infrastructure, develop educational materials (curricula, texts, webinars, workshops and courses), and train staff; 2) accelerate entrepreneurialism through innovator mentoring, SBIR/STTR application submission, and increased partnering activity; 3) increase visibility of technological advancements, industry partnerships and licensing revenues through outreach, coaching and partnering activities, at each of the Mountain West IDeA state institutions.
