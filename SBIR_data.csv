"MICROVI BIOTECH, INC.",SBIR Phase II: Field Demonstration of a Novel Biotechnology for In-Situ Bioremediation of Methyl Tert-Butyl Ether (MTBE) in Groundwater,National Science Foundation,,Phase II,SBIR,0319959,0450486,,,,,,2005,"$499,999.00 ",,N,N,N,4,,12313 West 126th Street,,Overland Park,KS,66213,Fatemeh R Shirazi ,Dr,(913) 897-4447,fatemeh.shirazi@stratumengineering.com,Fatemeh R Shirazi ,Dr,(913) 696-9934,fshirazi@microvibiotech.com,,,,,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a novel process for in-situ bioremediation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in groundwater. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers MTBE a potential human carcinogen. Currently, MTBE's Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) in drinking water has been set for 18 parts per billion. It is estimated that the cost of cleaning up MTBE contamination nationwide is $29 billion and growing. Bioremediation holds a great promise for destruction of MTBE in groundwater. The key problems with currently used bioremediation methods for MTBE are (1) the inability to establish high densities of MTBE- degrading bacterial, (2) the inability to maintain contact between the degrading bacteria and MTBE, and (3) the upsets and losses of key bacteria.  Prior Phase I work has successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of a new technical approach called Biological Permeable Barrier (BPB) that uses encapsulated MTBE-degrading bacteria for removal of MTBE in water.  The primary objective for the Phase II project is to assess the long-term performance of a BPB field pilot unit to remove MTBE at Port Hueneme Navy site, and to assess the cost and performance of the BPB / MicroBeads system for longer periods of time under field conditions. The novelties of this technical approach are four folds : (1) the proposed system will deliver high cell density of MTBE-degrading bacteria right to the zone of contamination; (2) the proposed system will create the perfect environment for bacteria with a high degree of degradation and stability; (3) the proposed system will protect the bacteria against environmental stresses; and, (4) the proposed system will prevent wash out of key bacteria. It is anticipated that the proposed BPB pilot scale unit at Port Hueneme will effectively degrade MTBE and other contaminants in groundwater to non-detectable levels. The immediate commercial application of this project will be on the bioremediation of MTBE in groundwater. However, the proposed technology holds promise for effective, controlled and cost efficient cleanup of groundwater at sites contaminated with other toxic and polluting chemicals as well. Other potential applications include the treatment of industrial wastewater and drinking water."

The innovation in this work is the combination of new nanoscale fabrication technologies with a new theory on biological olfaction based on electron tunneling, which may make possible the development of a true electronic nose that has significant performance improvements as compared to existing technologies.  The objective of this work is to determine the feasibility of using nano-fabrication techniques and structures to mimic biological olfaction so that toxic gases can be measured with significantly improved selectivity, stability, sensitivity, and response times.  This research will enhance scientific and technological understanding, and if successful, will allow the development of an electronic nose with significantly improved capabilities over existing technology.

Since its first appearance in North America, infestations of the newly invasive soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, have continued to cause a  significant soybean yield loss due to either direct feeding damage or the vectoring of  plant viruses by the aphid. In 2003, the total acreage with soybean aphid infestation was estimated at over 8 million, with yield loss ranging from 32% - 45% in the three biggest  soybean growing states in the U.S. (Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota). This project will investigate novel suppression strategies to reduce populations of this pest, thereby reducing the size of the subsequent populations feeding on soybeans. The commercial application of this project will be to manage aphids in the soybean crop. The research aims to increase knowledge of the chemical ecology of aphids, as well as provide a new understanding of how to use these novel  aphid sex pheromone-based control strategies most effectively. This will help growers in the U.S., the world's largest soybean exporting  country, to improve crop quality and yield at a minimal cost for soybean aphid management, thereby increasing their competitiveness in the world market."

Health risks at lower doses are not well understood and EPA studies are continuing to determine safe levels in drinking water.  Due to perchlorate anion's fundamental physical and chemical nature, the contamination is difficult to treat.                                                              The objective of this proposal is to develop sorbents based on NanoActive¿  materials for destructive adsorptive removal of perchlorate ions from contaminated water.  It is anticipated that the low capacity and/or slow kinetics of conventional sorbents towards perchlorte anions can be considerably improved by employ8ing unique NanoActive¿  materials as sorbents.  In order to meet the stated objective, NanoScale proposed to investigate NanoActive¿ TiO2 and its derivatives as adsorbents for removal of perhlorate from contaminated water.  NanoActive¿ materials should provide a substantial advantage over other conventional adsorbents since they possess the desired adsorbent characteristics such as high surface area, larfe pore size volume, as well as numerous defect sites, which lead to unique surface properties that can enhance their adsorptive capabilities.  The proposed work is divided into five tasks:  (1) Investigation of NanoActive¿ TiO2 for removal of perchlorate from contaminated water; (2) Preparation and characterization of Fe(II) incorporated NanoActive¿ TiO2; (3) Investigation of adsorption capabilities of modified NanoActive¿ materials; (4) Preliminary column adsorption experiments with promising materails; and (5) Preliminary economic and production scale-up studies to estimate overfall cost for utilization of nanoparticle-based perchlortae adsorbent.  Phase II research will be tested under ""real life"" conditions by introducing competing ions, typical temperature ranges and realistic flow rates.  NanoScale's goal is to develop novel, highly effective adsorbent materials for POU/POE filters."

Barium and strontium titanate are ferroelectric materials commonly used in multi layer ceramic capacitors and also as embedded capacitance in printed circuit boards.  Currently these material are synthesized using one of three primary methods.  These are sol-gel, hydrothermal crystallization or repeated communition followed by calcination.  The proposed research will utilize NanoScale Materials' extensive experience in the development, production and application of high performance nanocrystalline chemicals to product barium and strontium titanate materials with improved performance and using more environmentally friendly processes than the current state-of-the-art.  This will be done with a solid phase reaction process that eliminates the large organic solvent and wastewater streams associated with sol-gel or hydrothermal processes.  Preliminary research has shown that alkaline earth metal titanates can be produced using high surface area nanocrystalline precursors at significantly lower temperatures and with reduced communition intensity and residence time.  In the proposed research, NanoActive TiO2, which has a specific surface area of at least 500 m2/g, will be used as precursor material in conjuntion with commercially available alkaline earth metal oxides, hydroxides and carbonates.  Only environmentally friendly byproducts will be released.  The titanate materials produced will be evaluated for purity, textural characteristics, dielectric constant and electrical resistivity.  A comprehensive economic evaluation will then be done on the best performing electroceramic materials produced anda comparison to the state-of-the-art will be drawn.  Phase II research will focus on optimization of the prodouction processes with respect to the desired electronic properties and scaling of production capabilities to the pilot scale wsing methods that are further scalable to commercially viable production capacities.  It will also focus on adaptation of NanoScale's proprietary TiO2 production process to synthesize alkaline earth metal titanate coatings for electronic noise suppression applications."

Although extensive research on plasmid DNA purification methodologies has resulted in efficient purification processes, plasmid DNA production capacity is severely limited by low fermentation yield. The hypothesis of the proposed work is that E. coli plasmid DNA can be more efficiently produced by co-expression of an antisense RNA targeting the ColEI origin represser RNA (RNAI). The strategy will be to make designer antisense RNAI inhibitors, inducing them at the appropriate time to allow runaway replication of target plasmids. In Specific Aim 1, we will construct recombinant plasmids for expression of RNAI inhibitors. In Specific Aim 2, we will screen for antisense RNAI inhibitors useful for the production of plasmids. The overall goal of the proposed feasibility study is to determine whether such a bacterial strain is a significant advantage in the production of plasmid DNA using existing replicons (milestone I). If successful, Phase II studies will include: 1) improved constructs for insertion of the antisense RNA into the E. coli chromosome; 2) creating the strains needed and 3) fermentation process development. In Phase III, NTC will introduce the improved strains into commercial plasmid production.  Potential commercial applications  Success in constructing one or more useful strains of bacteria expressing RNAI inhibitor in a controllable fashion (milestone II) will help to overcome a major obstacle in the economical production of highly purified plasmid DNA for use in human Pharmaceuticals and DNA vaccines. Such strains will be rapidly introduced into Nature Technology's large scale DNA manufacturing process, and will also be made available for licensing to commercial users through the company's technology transfer and licensing program. Currently, experimental gene drugs and DNA vaccines are routinely made on the gram scale, mostly for use in animal safety and efficacy studies. However, the advent of FDA approved commercial products will require scaling up to kilograms, for example, for a widely used vaccine. Judging from the current price of $22,000- $46,000/gram of DNA produced, a less costly, scalable fermentation process is badly needed. The economic benefits and potential market size for the resulting products can be readily appreciated. The likelihood of a commercially useful and valuable product resulting from the proposed work is considered high."

By tagging and hybridizing defined DNA sequences with fluorochromes, abnormalities can be detected for specific chromosomal loci at much higher resolution (within individual chromosome bands). Commercially available DNA probes, which detect the most common abnormalities, bind to chromosomal targets of 40-1000 kb in length, making them useful for detection of large molecular chromosomal rearrangements. To detect much smaller rearrangements, we have synthesized small single copy (sc) FISH probes designed by genomic sequence analysis (1.5 to 8 kilobases) (Rogan et al, 2001). scFISH permits examination of the chromosome at the resolution of the Southern blot (~2kb). This increased genomic resolution has significant clinical, research and commercial implications, since abnormalities indistinguishable with commercial probes can be classified into distinct categorieswith scFISH probes. However, as a result of their shorter length and reduced chromosomal targets, the fluorescent hybridization signals are, in some instances, smaller than those seen using commercially-available probes. We aim (1) to develop a web-based application to simplify the selection of scFISH probes throughout the genome and (2) to increase the hybridization signal intensity of small scFISH probes by testing novel DNA labeling/detection technologies and benchmarking them against our currently validated protocol of indirect labeling and detection with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies. We will evaluate two approaches for increasing hybridization signal intensities of hybridized probes with reagents containing either high multiplicity fluorescent adducts (DNA dendrimers) or high quantum yield semicrystalline nanoparticles. The long range goal is to make sc probes as easy to select and visualize as conventional FISH probes so that they can be introduced into clinical cytogenetic laboratories."

While many diagnostic assays for infectious diseases rely upon detection of specific immunity, prion diseases apparently provoke no detectable immune response.  Alternative tests must therefore be developed based upon concomitant changes in gene expression associated with disease progression.  While a majority of pathogolical symptoms arise in the CNS, peripheral lymphoid tissues are an alternate site of prion proliferation.  These peripehral lymphoid organs would be preferable sites for the analysis of protein expression differences associated with prion disease.  The Canadian National Microbiology Laboratories have recently invested in a proteomics facility for the express purpose of analyzing transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.  We have partnered with this facility, due to it's unique expertise and proximity to our facility in Brookings, South Dakota.

The article, a 48”x48”x0.25” fiberglass fabric (24 ounces per square yard), will be subjected to a room corner test by the Navy as a proof of concept and validation of the superiority of the newly developed resin.    The Problem  Many have tried to accomplish the objective of developing an affordable, low viscosity resin that is curable at ambient temperature in the past.   Although Derakane® 510A, the workhorse of the industry, meets almost all the requirements at ambient temperature; it has a very short pot-life as well as a short time to ignition when subjected to flame.  The presence of styrene and other suspect carcinogens as well as the high heat release of the cured laminate make it unsuitable for the Navy’s present and future usage.   The solution to this problem is clear, development of an affordable, lower viscosity, non-carcinogenic, non-toxic replacement for phenolic resins and halogenated vinyl esters, specifically Derakane® 510A must be achieved.  The composite panels produced from this new resin are expected to meet the time to ignition, low heat release and non-smoking requirements set forth by the Navy.  This resin will be superior to Derakane® 510A in physical, thermal and rheological properties, as well as flame and chemical resistance.  The Opportunity  It has been shown that a thermoset system based on bisphenol C when properly processed will meet and exceed most fire or flame resistance requirements.

OR instruments address the following limitations in existing instruments to screen and diagnose middle-ear function: (1) detection of otitis media, (2) prediction of conductive hearing loss, (3) detection of middle-ear dysfunction in infants receiving a newborn hearing screening exam or follow-up audiologic assessment, and (4) general use to assess middle-ear function at frequencies in the bandwidth of speech. An OR test provides measurements over a wideband range (approximately 0.25 to 8 kHz) of such transfer functions as reflectance and admittance, and power absorbed by the ear canal and middle ear. Energy reflectance and absorbed power are OR functions that are relatively insensitive to probe position in the ear canal, and thus are well suited to interpreting middle-ear function at higher frequencies. One type of OR instrument can be used with probes similar to otoacoustic emission probes to screen middle-ear function in several seconds at ambient ear-canal pressure. Phase I of this project established the feasibility of measuring such OR responses in normal-hearing adults and children, as well as in children with surgically confirmed middle-ear fluid. Phase I also implemented a wideband OR test to assess the function of the middle-ear muscle reflex, and compared reflex thresholds in infants and adults with thresholds measured using conventional instruments. In Phase II, a wideband OR tympanometry instrument will be implemented, adding a pump to vary ear-canal static pressure, and OR tympanometry norms will be measured in adults. The test performance of ambient-pressure OR and conventional 226-Hz tympanometry will be compared in young children to detect middle-ear fluid and to predict a conductive hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion. OR tympanometry will form part of a new objective and efficient wideband test to measure middle-ear muscle reflex thresholds, which will be compared to thresholds in adults and infants measured using a conventional test. The test performance of the ability of OR tympanometry, ambient-pressure OR, and conventional 1000-Hz tympanometry to detect middle-ear dysfunction will be compared in infants also receiving a standard newborn hearing screening exam. Outcomes from Phase II will evaluate whether OR is more accurate than conventional tests to screen and diagnose middle-ear dysfunction in clinical applications of important societal concern."

The primary focus of the research is evacuation due to fires, but the software will be designed such that exposure and response to biological and chemical agents can also be simulated. The project will couple egress analysis to time-varying fire conditions (e.g. smoke density, heat, and CO) calculated using a Computational Fluid Dynamics fire simulator. This will enable simulation of emergency situations in which, for example, some exit paths become blocked. In addition to incorporating current human response models, the software will allow researchers to specify more complex individual behavior based on the results of recent studies of observed human behavior during emergencies. Thus, the project will not only result in a commercial product of immediate use to the fire safety industry, but will also provide a framework in which to incorporate future knowledge into a problem of fundamental importance to an urban society. This research will lead to a product that will facilitate broad use of fire emergency egress analysis and will introduce a new technology (coupling egress analysis with CFD fire modeling) into the present fire safety design and regulation process. In 2003 fire claimed 3,925 American lives and caused direct losses of $12.3 billion, with a total economic cost of $165 billion. Any technology that reduces even a fraction of this cost will be significant. The integration of egress analysis with fire simulation provides new capability to more accurately simulate emergency building evacuation. The engineering time required for the analyses will be significantly reduced by a common user interface and geometry database that will enable the broader application of this technology throughout the fire safety industry. Societal impacts include increased public safety, advancement in fire research, and reduced building costs.

Typical transplant survivals are more than 10 years. Because of an acute shortage of human donors, however, most do not receive their needed heart graft. Whereas approximately 2300 transplants are performed annually in the United States, it has been estimated that 50,000 could benefit, if a donor were available. In the developed world, the unmet need is estimated at 135,000 transplants per year. The use of donor pigs could readily resolve this severe shortage of organ donors. Pigs can be raised under very clean conditions and would eliminate the risk of spreading human infections and tumors. The physiology of the pig heart is also very similar to human hearts. However, pig heart xenografts are vigorously rejected. With conventional and transgenic donor pigs, increased immune suppression is required to prolong graft survival. This has raised concern about transmission of zoonotic infections to the recipient. The problem is that multiple immune reactions by the host against multiple xenoantigens destroy the graft.   Ximerex, Inc. has developed proprietary technology that prevents acute xenograft rejection, including acute vascular rejection, without the need for severe immune suppression. By growing the recipient lymphocytes within donor fetal pigs, the goals of transplantation, specific immune tolerance to the pig and accommodation of the pig tissues, are achieved within the donor animal, before transplantation. Ximerex would process and grow the patient's marrow cells in the donor pig and provide chimeric spleen lymphocytes and an accommodated donor heart to the transplant center. The value of chimeric donor pigs has been demonstrated with pig to sheep heart transplants, including transplants into sensitized sheep with preformed anti-pig antibodies. With modest immune suppression, prolonged graft survival was observed. Furthermore, prolonged survival of pig islets (>150 days) in rhesus macaques was achieved without any post-transplant immune suppression. Heart explants from chimeric pigs demonstrate accommodation with protection against antibodies and complement, including fresh human blood. RNA for proteins associated with accommodation is upregulated in the heart tissue.    The proposed SBIR project would complete the preclinical studies required for FDA allowance of phase I/II clinical trials. The Phase I SBIR proposal would establish in pilot studies the efficacy of transplanting chimeric donor pig hearts into non-human primates with hide or no immune suppression. Follow up studies would establish the relative contribution of tissue accommodation and specific immune tolerance to the prolongation of heart xenograft survival."

Barium and strontium titanate are ferroelectric materials commonly used in multilayer ceramic capacitors and as embedded capacitance in printed circuit boards. Currently, these materials are synthesized using one of three primary methods. These methods include sol-gel, hydrothermal crystallization, or repeated communition followed by calcination. 

This research project will utilize NanoScale Materials, Inc.’s extensive experience in the development, production, and application of high-performance nanocrystalline chemicals to produce barium and strontium titanate materials with improved performance, using more environmentally friendly processes than the current state-of-the-art. This will be accomplished with a solid-phase reaction process that eliminates the large organic solvent and wastewater streams associated with sol-gel or hydrothermal processes. Preliminary research has shown that alkaline earth metal titanates can be produced using high surface area nanocrystalline precursors at significantly lower temperatures and with reduced communition intensity and residence time. NanoActive™ TiO2, which has a specific surface area of at least 500 m2/g, will be used as a precursor material in conjunction with commercially available alkaline earth metal oxides, hydroxides, and carbonates. Only environmentally friendly byproducts will be released. 

The titanate materials produced will be evaluated for purity, textural characteristics, dielectric constant, and electrical resistivity. A comprehensive economic evaluation then will be conducted on the best performing electroceramic materials produced, and a comparison to the state-of-the-art will be drawn. Phase II will focus on optimization of the production process with respect to the desired electronic properties and scaling of production capabilities to the pilot scale using methods that are further scalable to commercially viable production capacities.

NanoActive™ materials should provide a substantial advantage over other conventional adsorbents because they possess desired adsorbent characteristics such as high surface areas, large pore size and pore volume, and numerous defect sites, which lead to unique surface properties that can enhance their adsorptive capabilities. 

The project is divided into five tasks: (1) investigation of NanoActive™ TiO2 for removal of perchlorate from contaminated water; (2) preparation and characterization of Fe(II) incorporated NanoActive™ TiO2; (3) investigation of the adsorption capabilities of modified NanoActive™ materials; (4) preliminary column adsorption experiments with promising materials; and (5) preliminary economic and production scale-up studies to estimate the overall cost of using a nanoparticle-based perchlorate adsorbent. 

Phase II will focus on determining the application process for the down-selected adsorbent(s). These formulations will be tested under “real life” conditions by introducing competing ions, typical temperature ranges, and realistic flow rates. NanoScale Materials’ aim is to develop novel, highly effective adsorbent materials for point-of-use/point-of-entry filters."

By tagging and hybridizing defined DNA sequences with fluorochromes, abnormalities can be detected for specific chromosomal loci at much higher resolution (within individual chromosome bands). Commercially available DNA probes, which detect the most common abnormalities, bind to chromosomal targets of 40-1000 kb in length, making them useful for detection of large molecular chromosomal rearrangements. To detect much smaller rearrangements, we have synthesized small single copy (sc) FISH probes designed by genomic sequence analysis (1.5 to 8 kilobases) (Rogan et al, 2001). scFISH permits examination of the chromosome at the resolution of the Southern blot (~2kb). This increased genomic resolution has significant clinical, research and commercial implications, since abnormalities indistinguishable with commercial probes can be classified into distinct categorieswith scFISH probes. However, as a result of their shorter length and reduced chromosomal targets, the fluorescent hybridization signals are, in some instances, smaller than those seen using commercially-available probes. We aim (1) to develop a web-based application to simplify the selection of scFISH probes throughout the genome and (2) to increase the hybridization signal intensity of small scFISH probes by testing novel DNA labeling/detection technologies and benchmarking them against our currently validated protocol of indirect labeling and detection with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies. We will evaluate two approaches for increasing hybridization signal intensities of hybridized probes with reagents containing either high multiplicity fluorescent adducts (DNA dendrimers) or high quantum yield semicrystalline nanoparticles. The long range goal is to make sc probes as easy to select and visualize as conventional FISH probes so that they can be introduced into clinical cytogenetic laboratories."

OR instruments address the following limitations in existing instruments to screen and diagnose middle-ear function: (1) detection of otitis media, (2) prediction of conductive hearing loss, (3) detection of middle-ear dysfunction in infants receiving a newborn hearing screening exam or follow-up audiologic assessment, and (4) general use to assess middle-ear function at frequencies in the bandwidth of speech. An OR test provides measurements over a wideband range (approximately 0.25 to 8 kHz) of such transfer functions as reflectance and admittance, and power absorbed by the ear canal and middle ear. Energy reflectance and absorbed power are OR functions that are relatively insensitive to probe position in the ear canal, and thus are well suited to interpreting middle-ear function at higher frequencies. One type of OR instrument can be used with probes similar to otoacoustic emission probes to screen middle-ear function in several seconds at ambient ear-canal pressure. Phase I of this project established the feasibility of measuring such OR responses in normal-hearing adults and children, as well as in children with surgically confirmed middle-ear fluid. Phase I also implemented a wideband OR test to assess the function of the middle-ear muscle reflex, and compared reflex thresholds in infants and adults with thresholds measured using conventional instruments. In Phase II, a wideband OR tympanometry instrument will be implemented, adding a pump to vary ear-canal static pressure, and OR tympanometry norms will be measured in adults. The test performance of ambient-pressure OR and conventional 226-Hz tympanometry will be compared in young children to detect middle-ear fluid and to predict a conductive hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion. OR tympanometry will form part of a new objective and efficient wideband test to measure middle-ear muscle reflex thresholds, which will be compared to thresholds in adults and infants measured using a conventional test. The test performance of the ability of OR tympanometry, ambient-pressure OR, and conventional 1000-Hz tympanometry to detect middle-ear dysfunction will be compared in infants also receiving a standard newborn hearing screening exam. Outcomes from Phase II will evaluate whether OR is more accurate than conventional tests to screen and diagnose middle-ear dysfunction in clinical applications of important societal concern."

The temporal jitters are less than 50 ns from the initial trigger signal to the firing of each EFI.  This enables precise control of the detonation wave in an explosive from multiple initiation points.  The system is comprised of a control module which generates programmable delay signals to 1.5 cm3 EFI drivers that are co-located near the EFI itself to minimize inductive and resistive losses.  All components are COTS for reduced cost and quick development.  Feasibility is demonstrated at the end of the Phase I OPTION by measuring the performance of a system firing 4 EFIs with independent delays for each EFI up to 5 microseconds and 50 ns jitter.  Two EFI manufacturers and a commercial end user are assisting in this development to assure its success.

Results from Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of using bioinformatics to automatically identify chemical components in complex matrices analyzed by GCxGC-MS. Phase II will carry out further theoretical and experimental research to develop solutions that will enable broader use of  GCxGC-MS system. The key project objectives include (a) developing a hybrid method that combines three approaches for chemical identification from GCxGC-MS data, (b)  establishing the mathematical foundation and practical algorithms for co-elution analysis in GCxGC-MS, and (3) developing new XML technologies for shared and distributed GCxGC-MS data, metadata, and information.  The commercial impact of this project will be to develop information technologies for a new generation of analytical instruments. GCxGC-MS system is likely to capture a significant share of the existing gas chromatography market, currently in excess of $ 1 billion per year, and to open new markets in applications requiring superior separations.

The project's goal will be accomplished by further optimizing the microdisplay device structural design and fabrication process based on the demonstrative results obtained in Phase I. Based on high-efficiency semiconductor micro-light-emitting diode (microLED) array technology, the GaN microdisplay is the first of its kind based on semiconductor LEDs. Specifically, by the hybrid integration of GaN microLED arrays with Si CMOS driver circuits through flip-chip bonding, active matrix addressable GaN microdisplays will have a compact size and will be able to support more information content and movie display due to their high pixel filling factor, uniformity, luminance, and power efficiency. The unique intrinsic properties of GaN microLEDs - high brightness (> 10 microwatt  optical output power for microLEDs of 18 micrometer in diameter), wide viewing angle (~ 160 degrees), fast response time (< 1 ns), and high thermal and vibrational resistance, make GaN microdisplays a perfect solution for environmentally demanding applications such as head-up displays (HUD) in modern vehicles and aircrafts, head-mounted displays (HMD) for firefighters and other rescue operatives, and hand-held mini-projectors for field applications.  Microdisplays have a small size (typically less than 1 inch diagonal) with a resolution from low end to above XVGA format. They are magnified by optics to form enlarged virtual or projected images for viewing by a user. Microdisplays can be used in a variety of devices such as head-mounted displays, video headsets, camcorder viewfinders, projection TV, head-up displays, etc. and have many commercial applications. GaN microdisplay, with its superior performance over other microdisplay technologies, is especially suitable for environmentally demanding applications that require high brightness, high reliability, and wide operating temperature range. With a slight modification of the material composition, GaN microLED arrays developed here can vary the emitted wavelength from the green to the ultraviolet range, which is very suitable for fluorescence analysis used in new type chemical-biology agent detector array or DNA/protein microchips. The GaN microLED array also has the potential for applications such as optical links and parallel computing. Other applications also include spatially resolved optical studies of biological, medical, and health care systems. The research will also enrich the general knowledge of wide bandgap semiconductor micro- and nano-photonics."

The present set of studies utilizes the techniques of precipitation with compressed antisolvent to produce nanoparticulate paclitaxel. The effects of nanoparticulate paclitaxel on the progression of ovarian cancer in a surgically debulked and non-debulked mouse model will be assessed. The first Aim will focus on production of the nanoparticulate paclitaxel. The second part of Aim 1 will assess the effects of nanoparticulate paclitaxel on the progression of ovarian cancer in a syngeneic mouse model. The effects of nanoparticulate paclitaxel delivered intravenoussly or intraperitoneally will be compared to the effects of Taxol(R), the current commercial formulation delivered intravenously or intrapedtoneally. We hypothesize nanoparticulate paclitaxel functions, at least in part, by acting as a reservoir providing a slow release of paclitaxel. This hypothesis will be examined in the studies described in the second Aim. The pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of nanoparticulate paclitaxel and Taxol(R) will be measured in a time dependent manner following intravenous or intraperitoneal delivery in normal non-tumor bearing, tumor debulked, and non-debulked mice. Paclitaxel will be measured by mass spectrometry in the ascites fluid, plasma, organs, tumors, peritoneal immune cells and peritoneal tumor cells.  
Nanoparticulate paclitaxel within cells will further be visualized by transmission electron microscopy. The information gained by completion of the proposed studies will not be limited to paclitaxel but can be extended to other drugs. This information will have the potential to improve the efficacy of several drugs, as many have limited water solubility and exhibit toxicity related to formulation, and ultimately provide safer treatments to cancer patients. In addition novel insights will be gained by completion of the comparitive studies in debulked and nondebulked animals related to the effects of adhesions on treatment outcomes and drug pharmacokinetics and disposition. These studies will assess the potential of nanoparticulate paclitaxel delivered intraperitoneally as a means to improve on the current treatment of women with ovarian cancer."

Active noise reduction (ANR) has long been known as the best method of controlling low-frequency noise but has been limited by available technologies.  Recent developments in modern control methods and microprocessors have made active noise reduction a practical, realizable solution for controlling low-frequency noise.  Etrema Products, Inc. proposes to implement an ANR system to reduce noise levels from shipboard flight operations by >20 dBA over the frequency range from 50-800 Hz.  The proposed approach uses a combination of active structural acoustic control and active noise cancellation by vibrating ship bulkheads and/or speaker panels to actively control noise in ship compartments using the magnetostrictive material, TERFENOL-D.  The Phase I effort will be to generate a design concept, demonstrate its feasibility through modeling, and develop a concept validation plan.

Many of these individuals use motor vehicles for transportation purposes. Due to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) there is an increase of accessible i vehicles, allowing wheelchair occupants to stay seated in their wheelchair during transit. Unlike OEM motor vehicle seats, wheelchairs are not designed to protect occupants from injury during (motor vehicle) impact. Besides failure of wheelchair frames and caster fork assemblies during normal wheelchair usage, study findings also indicate that wheelchair caster-fork assemblies (front wheels) are often incapable of withstanding the forces associated with crash level loading. Extreme caster-fork bending or metal fracture exposes wheelchair seated individuals to increased risk of injury when compared to other vehicle passengers seated in OEM seats.  
The aim of this project is for FrogLegs Inc. to develop a crash load absorbing caster-fork assembly for use on power wheelchairs to reduce risk of injury to wheelchair riders in motor vehicles. The proposed design features energy-absorbing qualities and shall withstand crash loads up to 8,000N associated with those experienced in a motor vehicle crash. The design will minimize wheelchair and occupant excursions (motions), loads and accelerations during frontal impact and rebound associated with frontal impact. In collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh, the following aims have been stated:   
1. Find effective energy absorption characteristic for a front caster-fork assembly that minimizes wheelchair and occupant excursions and accelerations when a wheelchair is in a vehicle accident.

(IMTT) teaming Boeing West is proposing Flat Geometry Remote Field & Super Sensitive Eddy Current (FG RFEC & SSEC ) technique for inspection of fastener holes in thick multi-layer structures.  To detect cracks in a multi-layer Ti-Al-Ti ¡VAl structure with two thicknesses,  0.38¡""+2.0""+0.38""+0.65¡"" and 0.9¡""+0.9¡""+0.9¡""+0.5¡"", as described in the Topic AF04-134, is a big challenge to any exiting or emerging NDI techniques. Examples include:  1. Ultrasonic techniques (UT), including guided UT, are incapable of penetrating through air gaps between two adjacent layers without sealant.   2. Most eddy current techniques (ECT), including these emerging techniques, such as MOI, MWM, EC array, Rivet Check, etc., have inherently limitation in penetration depth from their working principle ¡V the Skin Depth. They have little potential in further extending their penetration depths.  3. Super-conductive Quanta Interface Device (SQUID) can have deeper penetration with the help of super conducting materials working at extremely low temperature. However, the cooling system and the low temperature itself create problems, such as large size and weight, high cost, high noise, etc., which are not acceptable in practical aircraft NDI applications.  Among all ECT¡¦s the FG RFEC & SSEC is the only one that its penetration depth is not limited by Skin-Depth, because the signal received by its receiving unit has penetrated through the object wall twice and carries clean signal about the wall conditions. Therefore, FG RFEC & SSEC is the most promising technique in reaching the goal set in this project topic description.  Current FG RFEC & SSEC technique uses only about 0.4 watt for driving a probe and is capable of detecting flaws that are 0.8¡"" below surface in multi-layer aluminum structures. There is not any question to increase the driving power to 10 or even 100 times and further extend its penetration depth many times.  Replacing the currently used coil sensor with a magnetic sensor, such as GMR, would make more increase in the sensitivity of the FG RFEC & SSEC technique.  In this project IMTT will be responsible for the development of the proposed  technique, while Boeing West will provide guidance, the NDI experiences working with B1-B airplane, tests specimens and validation of the technology development.  The Phase I objective is to prove the potential and feasibility of the proposed technique in detecting cracks deeply hidden in thick and multi-layer structures described in Topic Description. Two approaches, numerical simulation and experimental test, will be conducted in parallel. By the end of Phase I a presentation/demonstration will be performed to show the simulation and experimental test results on specimens provided by AFRL/Project Sponsor.  Mr. Sun, Yushi, President of IMTT and Principal Investigator, has more than 18 years experiences in R&D of FG RFEC & SSEC technique, as well as in finite element modeling of electromagnetic NDI phenomena. He is an active and Founder Member of International Computation Electromagnetics Society, COMPUMAG and was a Session Chair and a member of the Editorial Board for a number of international conferences in computational electromagnetics and electromagnetic NDI.

This will be accomplished by a vaccine design in which a conformationally biased, response-selective agonist  Of C5a (YSFKPMPLaR) is used as a molecular adjuvant, a nicotine hapten is used as the target antigen (Ag), and a nonhuman B cell epitope is used to assist hapten processing by antigen presenting cells (APC). The ability of such vaccines to induce anti-nicotine responses will be assessed by vaccinating rats in the absence of added adjuvant and demonstrating: 1) the presence of nicotine-specific Abs in immune sera and 2) an attenuation of nicotine-induced psychoactive effects in two well-established rat models of nicotine dependence - locomotor activity and drug appetitive conditioning. Validation of this peptide-based nicotine vaccine represents the first step toward realization of the broad, commercial objective sought by this project, which is to use vaccination to nicotine with such vaccines as a standard therapeutic regimen for smoking cessation and maintenance of long term compliance. As has been shown in rats, the therapeutic effect in humans will result from the ability of Abs generated in response to the vaccine to bind circulating nicotine with high affinity/selectivity, thereby decreasing nicotine distribution to the brain where it exerts its addictive effects. The central design feature of this nicotine vaccine design is YSFKPMPLaR, which has been shown to be n effective molecular adjuvant in the induction of Ab responses to peptide and non-peptide Ags. Thus, it is hypothesized that an effective YSFKPMPLaR-containing nicotine vaccine can be developed for human use when a nonhuman B cell epitope is used for assistance in nicotine hapten processing and presentation. This hypothesis will be evaluated by the following specific aims: 1) To test YSFKPMPLaR-containing nicotine vaccines, which utilize nonhuman epitopes to assist hapten processing and presentation, for their ability to produce anti-nicotine Abs in rats immunized in the absence of added adjuvants, and 2) To evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination with the vaccine(s) from Aim 1 in attenuating nicotine-induced behavioral effects in two well-characterized rat models of nicotine dependence. A nicotine vaccine that satisfies these aims would be a candidate vaccine for human clinical trials in  
Treating nicotine dependence via vaccination as an approach for smoking cessation."

Definitive antemortem tests for TSEs are lacking, primarily due to an inability to expand the small amounts of infective prion protein found in the blood of asymptomatic individuals.  To date, only rodent cell lines have been used to expand murine-adapted scrapie protein.  Unfortunately, cell lines from other susceptible species (including deer and elk) are lacking.  The two major cell types which appear to concentrate PrPSc during infection are nerve cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs).  FDCs have the unique ability to concentrate foreign proteins due to a specific interaction with complement components.  We have successfully used a magnetic-bead separation based methodology to isolate and culture FDCs from sheep, and have confirmed the utility of these reagents against deer and elk cells.

The short operating life, low cost, linear amplification, and wide range of frequency and modulations together comprise a challenging specification for such an amplifier.  However, attaining these capabilities will result in proliferation of communications-equipped loitering weapons, which will result in a very significant increase in lethality and military effectiveness by virtue of increasing the weapon's situational awareness and precision.  Softronics offers a novel approach based on Silicon Carbide (SiC) technology, and specifically a monolithic, direct-coupled power amplifier spanning 0-4 GHz.  The superior thermal characteristics of SiC, combined with its 10 GHz cutoff frequency, radiation hardness, and very small die sizes, allow a small MMIC to be economically built using existing 2 inch wafer processing facilities.

The primary focus of the research is evacuation due to fires, but the software will be designed such that exposure and response to biological and chemical agents can also be simulated. The project will couple egress analysis to time-varying fire conditions (e.g. smoke density, heat, and CO) calculated using a Computational Fluid Dynamics fire simulator. This will enable simulation of emergency situations in which, for example, some exit paths become blocked. In addition to incorporating current human response models, the software will allow researchers to specify more complex individual behavior based on the results of recent studies of observed human behavior during emergencies. Thus, the project will not only result in a commercial product of immediate use to the fire safety industry, but will also provide a framework in which to incorporate future knowledge into a problem of fundamental importance to an urban society. This research will lead to a product that will facilitate broad use of fire emergency egress analysis and will introduce a new technology (coupling egress analysis with CFD fire modeling) into the present fire safety design and regulation process. In 2003 fire claimed 3,925 American lives and caused direct losses of $12.3 billion, with a total economic cost of $165 billion. Any technology that reduces even a fraction of this cost will be significant. The integration of egress analysis with fire simulation provides new capability to more accurately simulate emergency building evacuation. The engineering time required for the analyses will be significantly reduced by a common user interface and geometry database that will enable the broader application of this technology throughout the fire safety industry. Societal impacts include increased public safety, advancement in fire research, and reduced building costs.

Broad range molecular detection of bacteria in clinical specimens is an approach that parallels a conventional culture-based approach, may be more rapid, and offers the possibility of identifying so-called ""non-culturable"" organisms. A common molecular target used for broad range detection of bacteria using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Primers are designed based on areas of 16S rDNA sequence conserved amongst bacteria; sequencing of the amplified DNA yields data which can be used to identify the source organism. Our research collaborator, Dr. Robin Patel, at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, has extensive experience with this approach. Unfortunately, this technique is not applicable to the direct diagnosis of polymicrobial bacterial infections unless the mixed 16S rDNA amplification products can be separated and then separately sequenced. Traditional approaches to separation of mixed amplification products include temperature gradient gel electrophoresis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and cloning; these approaches are cumbersome, especially for use in the routine diagnostic setting.  
  
The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate a new application for separation of mixed 16S rDNA amplification products prior to sequencing - denaturing high performance liquid chromatography using the WAVE(r) System (Transgenomic Inc., Omaha NE).

ACIM is a means of constructively controlling acoustic microcavitation. Substrates are not harmed. The ACIM deBonder(trade mark) will be applicable to any type of film or coating that can be eroded in a controlled manner by cavitation. It is essentially a nondestructive method that only uses small areas of films. No special sample preparation is needed and the method is capable of in situ inspection.

The broader impacts of this project will be a new method of determining the adhesion strength of thin films; it is expected to advance the science of thin film engineering. The controlled erosion of ACIM can itself be used to create nascent surfaces in preparation for thin film deposition. Ultimately, the principle of ACIM deBonder (trade mark) relies controlled caviational erosion in fact it relies on controlling the very fundamental process of phase change, the control of nucleation--the ability to convert a liquid into a gas in the vicinity of a solid phase.

Phase I  
  
The current proposal describes the selection of an aptamer that recognizes the drug PD173955, which is one of large family of substituted pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine inhibitors of tyrosine protein kinases. An aptamer is a single stranded nucleic acid that acts like an antibody but that can be expressed and function inside cells. The PD173955 RNA aptamer will be selected to lay the groundwork for developing a novel imaging technology that could also be used for enhancing drug therapy. The Concept is that the aptamer, present inside the cell or targeted to the cell surface, could concentrate drug in or around the cell. A radioactive analogue of the drug could be used for imaging.  
The proposed basis of imaging involves accumulation of radiolabeled drug by aptamers. The increased intracellular or pericellular drug concentration in the cell should increase the effectiveness of the drug. However, the kinetic parameters of the aptamer are expected to be very important for optimal imaging and therapeutic enhancement. Therefore, we are developing a computational model that is based on a mathematical rendering of the kinetic and diffusion constants of the aptamer, drug and the enzyme targeted by the drug. Development of the mathematical model will proceed in parallel with the aptarner selection and guide the choice of selection protocols.  
The following specific aims are proposed for development of an aptamer to PD173955 for imaging and therapeutic applications: 1) prepare PD173955 linked to a solid support for aptamer selection, 2) select an RNA aptamer that recognizes PD173955, and 3) develop a mathematical model for the use of aptamers in imaging and enhancing drug therapy.  
  
Phase II  
  
The current proposal describes a novel nucleic acid structure based on aptamers that will be expressed in cells to mark them so they can be detected in viva by available imaging technology. We call the markers intracellular Multi-Aptamer Genetic Tags"" (IMAGEtags). The basic innovation in the proposed IMAGEtag design is the expression, in living cells, of aptamers that can be used to track the cells in vivo by a noninvasive procedure. Cells that express IMAGEtags will be detected by virtue of the concentrated radiolabeled ligands that are bound and trapped in the cells by the aptarner components of IMAGEtags. The promoter from which the IMAGEtags are expressed will determine which cells can be imaged. For example, many genes that are responsible for increased proliferation are expressed in cancer cells and not in most normal cells. If these promoters, or a ""synthetic"" promoter that was highly expressed only in cancer cells, were used to drive IMAGEtag expression then cancer cells would be imaged.  
We also propose that the IMAGEtags could also be applied to enhancing drug therapy. Because the mechanism of imaging involves accumulation of ligand, IMAGEtas that recognize a particular drug could draw more drug into the cell and increase the effectiveness of the drug.  
The design and selection of IMAGEtags and their target ligands will be guided by computational modeling to optimize the kinetic characteristics of the aptamers and their ligands for imaging and enhanced therapeutic applications.  
Development of MAGEtags for imaging and therapeutic applications will be achieved by the following specific aims: 1) refine the PD173955 aptamer to function inside cells and prepare cells that stably express the aptamer, 2) refine the mathematical model for in vivo imaging, 3) validate the ability to image with aptamers in vivo using cultured cells, and 4) Use the PD173955 aptamer to image in animals."

III-nitride HFETs have great promises in microwave/millimeter-wave electronics applications. However, one of the critical issues in the development ofhigh performance devices is the degradation of the gate that leads to the premature breakdown and hence a deficient device performance with a reduction of output power, the RF efficiency and noise figure.  Much improvement in epitaxial materials qualityand device structure design is needed.  The proposed research targets at the aforementioned issues.   The objectives are to¿      further optimize AlGaN/GaN HFET material and structural quality by employing innovative approaches such as barrier delta doping to enhance the drain-current-driving and gate-control and hence power/current delivering capabilities, while increasebreakdown voltage and reduce leakage current as well as the current collapse effect.¿      develop innovative approaches for processing III-nitride HFETs, including e-beam- and deep UV photo-lithography patterning, plasma dry etching,  and contact metallization;¿    fabricate HFET devices for extensive testing under RF power (~10 GHz - X-band) conditions.  The technologies based on GaN high power electronic devices will be extremely important for future DOD technologies, including radar and microwave/millimeterwave communications (terrestrial, airbone, and space-based).  In a broad sense, semiconductorelectronics play an important role in the overall functioning of national defense and military weapons systems.  In the area of civilian applications, modern microelectronic devices based on semiconductor HFETs have a wide range of applications, includingcommunications such as radar links, direct broadcast satellite television, cellular telephone, cable television converters, and data processing applications.  The HFETs devices fabricated in other technologies (e.g. AlGaAs) have been in production for manyyears.  However, the modern microelectronic industry is constantly face demands for higher performance as well as lower costs.  III-nitrides are emerging as one of the most important electronic materials for these applications due to their very high peakelectron velocity, high saturation velocity, high breakdown voltage, low noise, and thermal stability of the system."

BioForce Nanosciences, Inc., has developed proprietary technology for the construction of NanoArrays/TM, an ultra miniaturized assay platform that allows a thousand or more molecular tests to be carried out in the same surface space occupied by a single standard microarray spot. Using this technology, we propose to build a 9 component antibody sandwich NanoArray and test its sensitivity, precision and linearity using mouse recombinant cytokines and cell culture model systems. The size reduction offered by the NanoArray platform, relative to the conventional microarray format, provides a mechanism for the creation of diagnostic tests that require extremely small sample volumes, approaching that of a single cell. This assay system is particularly well-suited for studies involving small animal model systems, where conventional analysis techniques may require lethal amounts of starting sample material. We predict that our system will provide robust protein profiling data from mouse tail-bleeds, needle biopsy aspirates, and finger pricks of human blood samples. Furthermore, the NanoArray platform provides the benefits of miniaturization but still allows readout using standard fluorescence methods permitting data collection from a single image. This attribute increases the availability of array-based bioanalyses for scientists with limited budgets and/or instrumentation resources, and opens the doorway for clinical testing not currently possible with existing methodology.  
We have chosen cytokine biomarkers for our Phase I study. Cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of diseases of the kidney and digestive systems, including diabetes, progressive renal failure and inflammatory bowel disease. Using the cytokine benchmark will allow us to produce a NanoArray biomarker screen that can be compared with existing standard ELISA and microarray-based tests, and be immediately useful to researchers using transgenic mouse models of disease. Development of this assay will pave the way for Phase 11development of protein profiling chips tailored to other disease targets and/or signaling pathways, for use in mouse model systems, and for human testing involving extremely small sample volumes."

However, current commercially available desulfurization technologies have significant energy requirements due to the severe operating conditions (such as high temperatures and pressures) and their use of hydrogen (which requires additional energy to produce).  As a further drawback, most gasoline desulfurization processes degrade the quality of the gasoline, resulting in additional energy consumption.  This project will develop a catalytically active solvent process that will extract sulfur compounds from refinery fuel streams.  In Phase I, well-known catalytically active compounds will be formulated and added to solvents selected from a novel group of compounds.  Then, the catalytically active solvent will be evaluated for its ability to extract the sulfur compounds from representative gasoline and diesel fuel blending streams.  Finally, methods for regenerating the sulfur-containing solvent will be evaluated.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by awardee:  The catalytic extraction of sulfur compounds from refinery fuel streams under mild conditions, without the use of hydrogen and without degrading the quality of the product, should save energy and other operating costs.  A processing unit based on this technology would use simple, well-known operating techniques and would be expected to require less capital than current technologies."

The Phase I proof-of-concept demonstrated the accelerateddelivery of BChE into the circulatory system using needle-free injection.  The second phase of this project will consist of the following three tasks:  1)  Develop and quantify a prototype needle-free injector.  This task includes product, environmentaland human safety testing.  A protector cap will be used to prevent pathogen transfer between patients;  2) Conduct trials on non-human primates to determine the percent of enzyme delivered, the peak level of enzyme activity and the duration of the enzymeat that level;  3) Determine the efficacy of this enzyme as a bioscavenger by exposing injected rodents to OP or pesticides; and 4) Deliver a prototype injector to the Army for chemical warfare studies.  The overall goal of this project is to provide theArmy with a system to allow rapid injection of the enzyme into soldiers in the event of a chemical attach on the battlefield.  In order to achieve this goal, the usability, safety and efficacy of the device will be proven. For the military, this devicewould allow rapid injection of troops prior to a potential chemical exposure.  In this situation, troops should be injected 12 hours prior to possible exposure and re-injected weekly as long as the threat continues.  Needle-free injection has been shown tobe faster, less painful, safer and more efficacious.  In general, needle-free administration of vaccines, biologicals and antibiotics dramatically increase the speed of injection, improves drug absorption, reduces costs and eliminates the hazardsassociated with sharps and sharps disposal.

The refinement and validation of a statistical methodology for analyzing the effects of an anti-seizure therapy (brain electrical stimulation or BES) are proposed. This application incorporates a statistical model that can elicit trends, influences of biological rhythms on seizure susceptibility and the effects of changes in treatment parameters on epileptic activity using the automated output of a proven seizure detection algorithm over the duration of a clinical study, thus leading to improved therapies. The method will be tested on a database of clinical BES trials for possible implementation as a software tool for analysis and optimization of therapy. An empirical seizure prediction algorithm (eSPA) incorporating trend extraction with empirical models will be developed using a similar framework to test the predictability of a subject's seizures. The eSPA will be evaluated on an extensive human database of long time series. The proposed methods will determine the predictability of a subject's seizures from a certain data set, and whether the eSPA can be implemented in a portable/implantable warning device."

Development of appealing meat alternative products has been limited by existing equipment used to produce texturized soy protein, the 'meat alternative' in soyfoods. Heartland Fields is currently marketing 5 soy foods in over 1000 retail stores nationwide. The next generation of soyfood entrees will appeal to food service cutomers such as schools, hospitals, and the military, by offering high-protein, high-energy low-fat foods that Americans traditionally like to eat. Heartland Fields scientists are confident that testing and evaluation of twin-screw extrusion systems will result in an industry breakthrough for the conversion of high-protein, low-fat soy flours into texturized soy protein of heretofore unrealized likeness to real meat. This research will result in a new plant that will be owned by farmer-investors and supervised and operated by Heartland Fields personnel.

In Phase II, we will use statistical methods to determine which parameters are most strongly correlated to a correct base call, so that quality values may be developed. These values will be the single-molecule sequencing analogs of the quality scores used in PHRED and PHRAP from conventional DNA sequencing.   
  
A key advantage of single-molecule sequencing is the elimination of cloning and the laboratory infrastructure associated with high-throughput operations. This, along with reduced reagent consumption, results in sequencing costs orders of magnitude lower compared to existing methods. Read lengths will be tens of kilobases to simplify shotgun sequence assembly and preserve haplotype information. Applications include whole-genome sequencing, SNPs, haplotyping, genotype-trait associations, long-read SAGE for expression profiling, analysis of alternative mRNA splicing patterns, and comparative genomics within or between species. Fields-of-use include research, diagnostics and personalized medicine."

The working hypothesis is that these new nanofiber/glass systems will be of significantly higher mechanical quality than state-of-the-art technologies used in the field. Two materials scientists (Drs. Dzenis and Larsen, co-PI and PI, respectively) will collaborate with a faculty member from the College of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center (external consultant, Dr. Thomas Salinas) during Phase I. One of the current topics of emphasis in allceramic restorations research is on developing reliable large-span posterior fixed partial dentures (FPDs). This will be one of the central product development areas that the proposed technology will target toward the commercialization phase. The proposed R and D effort is in line with the mission and current strategic research areas of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR). It is anticipated that the novel glass-infiltrated materials will have excellent crack propagation resistance thanks to dense and continuous fibrous reinforcing scaffolds based on alumina, spinel, zirconia, mullite, or a combination of them to produce Dental ceramics with superior esthetic and mechanical qualities. During Phase I, emphasis will be on production of the first few, selected nanofiber-glass materials of this class, their mechanical testing (e.g., flexural strength and fracture toughness), and their microstructure characterization (e.g., porosity and defect population)."

Limited data collection on elderly men suggest HMB/ARG/LYS may not have an effect. The proposed study will expand on these preliminary studies in women to determine whether a combination of HMB, arginine, and lysine is effective in increasing whole body protein synthesis, fat-free mass, strength and functionality in both older adult men and women. Thirty-two subjects (16 men and 16 women) over the age of 65 years will be recruited and will be assigned to an isonitrogenous control treatment (n=16) or to the experimental treatment group (n=l 6) containing HMB (calcium salt), arginine, and lysine daily (HMB/ARG/LYS) for six weeks. Whole body protein turnover, body composition, strength and functionality will be used as measures of effectiveness. It is hypothesized that this mixture will support maximal protein synthesis and minimize proteolysis resulting in an increase in net protein balance.

During the hospital stay, malnutrition is a major complication in about 50% of the patient population. The result is muscle wasting which is a major risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality. In the study proposal presented we postulate that supplementation with Beta-hydroxy-Beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), arginine and glutamine (HMB/Arg/Gln) to these severely traumatized patients can stem the loss of muscle tissue and whole body nitrogen and in turn decrease morbidity and mortality. This hypothesis is based on two recent studies showing the same nutritional mixture of HMB/Arg/Gln can reverse the muscle wasting associated with AIDS and Cancer. The hypermetabolic state seen in AIDS and cancer have a similar multilifactorial etiology seen in trauma. There is an increase in the mobilization of fat and muscle, increased or normal metabolic rate, increased protein breakdown, and an increased or normal glucose turnover. In addition, HMB alone has been shown to reduce nitrogen loss, decrease muscle proteolysis and muscle damage within the first 48 hours to three week after initiating supplementation.  
Male and female patients (n=100) will be recruited at the time of admittance to the Trauma ICU with an ISS of greater than 18 Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion will be randomized to receive either 1) standard tube feed plus HMB/Arg/Gln, standard tube feed plus HMB alone, or standard tube feed (control) in a blinded fashion. Clinical outcomes measures will be assessed through out the hospital stay and on a outpatient basis on week 4 and week 12. Muscle proteolysis and nitrogen economy will be evaluated on daily basis while in the hospital and after 4 weeks on an out patient basis.  
If as expected, Phase I results confirm the effectiveness of the nutrient mixture in trauma patients. Expanded multicenter studies will be proposed in Phase II."

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers MTBE a potential human carcinogen. Currently, MTBE's Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) in drinking water has been set for 18 parts per billion. It is estimated that the cost of cleaning up MTBE contamination nationwide is $29 billion and growing. Bioremediation holds a great promise for destruction of MTBE in groundwater. The key problems with currently used bioremediation methods for MTBE are (1) the inability to establish high densities of MTBE- degrading bacterial, (2) the inability to maintain contact between the degrading bacteria and MTBE, and (3) the upsets and losses of key bacteria.  Prior Phase I work has successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of a new technical approach called Biological Permeable Barrier (BPB) that uses encapsulated MTBE-degrading bacteria for removal of MTBE in water.  The primary objective for the Phase II project is to assess the long-term performance of a BPB field pilot unit to remove MTBE at Port Hueneme Navy site, and to assess the cost and performance of the BPB / MicroBeads system for longer periods of time under field conditions. The novelties of this technical approach are four folds : (1) the proposed system will deliver high cell density of MTBE-degrading bacteria right to the zone of contamination; (2) the proposed system will create the perfect environment for bacteria with a high degree of degradation and stability; (3) the proposed system will protect the bacteria against environmental stresses; and, (4) the proposed system will prevent wash out of key bacteria. It is anticipated that the proposed BPB pilot scale unit at Port Hueneme will effectively degrade MTBE and other contaminants in groundwater to non-detectable levels. The immediate commercial application of this project will be on the bioremediation of MTBE in groundwater. However, the proposed technology holds promise for effective, controlled and cost efficient cleanup of groundwater at sites contaminated with other toxic and polluting chemicals as well. Other potential applications include the treatment of industrial wastewater and drinking water."

In 2003, the total acreage with soybean aphid infestation was estimated at over 8 million, with yield loss ranging from 32% - 45% in the three biggest  soybean growing states in the U.S. (Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota). This project will investigate novel suppression strategies to reduce populations of this pest, thereby reducing the size of the subsequent populations feeding on soybeans. The commercial application of this project will be to manage aphids in the soybean crop. The research aims to increase knowledge of the chemical ecology of aphids, as well as provide a new understanding of how to use these novel  aphid sex pheromone-based control strategies most effectively. This will help growers in the U.S., the world's largest soybean exporting  country, to improve crop quality and yield at a minimal cost for soybean aphid management, thereby increasing their competitiveness in the world market."

The chemical modification involves introducing Lewis acidic boron or Lewis basic alkoxy functionalities on the surface of the nanoparticles. It is expected that introduction of such sites should enhance the adsorptive capability and the destructive ability of the nanoparticles appreciably. In particular, boron, by virtue of its affinity for electronegative atoms (in nerve agents) and the thio group (in mustard agent and nerve agent VX) should bind and help pull these agents quickly through the nanoparticles. Lewis basic sites should enhance the chemical reactivity of the nanoparticles thereby promoting destruction of agents by reactions such as elimination and/or hydrolysis.

The core of this innovation is the high chemical reactivity of nanoparticle metal oxides, which leads to decomposition of toxic chemicals and formation of nontoxic byproducts. This reactivity provides means for permanent confinement of volatile toxic industrial chemicals that are not efficiently immobilized by physical adsorption only. If successful, the proposed approach will enable filtration of up to 100 additional toxic industrial chemicals in addition to approximately 50 compounds that are within capabilities of existing technologies.

This work capitalizes on target-induced amplitude and phase distortions in the reflected signal to generate an observation set comprised of isolated and potentially classifiable anomalies. The combined approach facilitates extraction of challenging targets such as dismounted terrorist forces in the presence of clutter and neighboring targets. Statistical methods to track these targets also facilitate data fusion from numerous sensors, which simultaneously increases target discrimination and sensor coverage.

Accordingly, this alternative approach to thermal detection of occupied caves was encouraged by the TPOC for this topic.  A phase IIaspiration of this work is to develop a portable flexible or fabric array that is responsive to the need for unattended underground facility and occupied cave detection cited in PE 06063762E (CUGF).  The phase I study will focus on human and subsurfaceutility detection in caves, subsurface cave mapping, and methods to deploy the sensor as an unattended unit.  This effort will conclude with design recommendations for wireless communications, sensor and receiver hardware composition, and target anomalyextraction techniques.  Component and algorithm selection will reflect a scoring system based on phase I experiments.  This technology, which is capable of both through wall and subsurface cave imaging, will enhance safety for law enforcement, search andrescue, fire, and military personnel by providing effective hands-free situational awareness.

There is a need to find an alternate material that will produce non-toxic gaseous material when subjected to flame.  The current halogenated resin has a tendency to breakdown and form acidic fumes which are more dangerous in most cases than the fireitself.  The objective of this proposal is to develop a resin system similar to Derekane 510A in every respect except for that fact that it will be non-styrene based and laden with halides.  The commercialization strategy of moving the result of this invention to the market is quite straightforward.  The strategy will involve forming an Integrated Product Team (IPT).  As a matter of fact the members of the team will include DuPont ElectronicTechnologies, whose main market objective is to service the electronics industry with highly branched, low metal polymers with photo-resist capability.   Following a successful development of the base material in Phase I, DuPont will play a significant role in Phase II of the project.  It will be an easy selection process for DuPont to select an end user of the product from their impressive customer list.DuPont also has ISO 9000 certified manufacture plant in Dayton, Ohio to scale up whatever material is developed through this effort.To date, more than nine resins have been commercialized by A.T.A.R.D.

OR instruments address limitations in existing screening and diagnostic instruments in such areas as: (1) detecting otitis media, (2) predicting conductive hearing loss, (3) augmenting the newborn hearing screening protocol to test for middle-ear dysfunction, and (4) the general assessment of middle-ear functioning at frequencies important for speech perception. OR provides calibrated measurements over a frequency range from approximately 0.25 to 8 kHz of such transfer functions as reflectance and admittance, and the power absorbed by the ear canal and middle ear. Energy reflectance and absorbed power are OR functions that are relatively insensitive to the position of the probe in the ear canal. This property may allow clinical interpretation of these functions at moderate and high frequencies at which the tympanometric admittance, which is sensitive to probe position, becomes difficult to interpret. One proposed class of OR instruments can be used with probes similar to otoacoustic emission probes to screen middle-ear functioning in several seconds at ambient pressure in the ear canal. Such rapidly performed measurements at ambient pressure may provide a test of middle-ear dysfunction in newborn hearing screening programs, and a test to screen for conductive hearing loss in children at risk for otitis media with effusion. Another proposed class of OR instruments, for which a static pressure pump will be added to the probe system, will be used to measured reflectance, admittance and absorbed power as functions of both frequency and static pressure in the ear canal. Such OR tympanometry instruments may have general audiological and screening utility for diagnosing middle-ear pathology due to the fact that the energy reflectance tympanogram has more orderly patterns at moderate and high frequencies than multifrequency tympanometers based only on admittance. A third proposed class of OR instruments may provide a sensitive test of the acoustic reflex threshold by measuring the wideband shift in OR responses elicited by a contralateral or ipsilateral activator sound. A protocol to measure supra-threshold reflex decay may provide additional wideband information that is unavailable in clinical reflex testing."

This proposal offers a technique for generating grids suitable for viscous analysis on complex configurations.The principle idea is to divide the region closest to the body into a sequance of inter-connected zones and generate body-conforming grids in these zones.The body-conforming grids are restricted to a prescribed normal distance from the body.The near-surface grids, partitioned into a number of patches, allow the automatic generation of the grids with aspect ratios suitable for viscous flows. In the outer region, where convection dominates, unstructured cartesian or cartesian-like meshes can begenerated quickly and easily. A transitional grid is used as a bridge between regions. The entire grid can be treated as one single-zoned unstructured grid with an unstructured solver or as a hybrid grid with multiple zones and multiple solvers. In thehybrid approach, viscous solvers are used for the near-body zone while the faster inviscid solvers can be used in the farfield. In Phase I a proof-of- concept grid generator will be demonstrated using candidate missle geometries. In the Option period,intial solver development will begin and be continued in Phase II.

Currently, chicory is grown primarily in Europe. In 2001, U.S. Chicory constructed a drying facility in Scottsbluff, NE and processed 950 acres of chicory, the first commercial operation in North America. Although dried chicory is suitable for pet foods, purified inulin is necessary for human food. Current inulin extraction methods are expensive ($200 million facility) and require the entire crop be processed in 45-60 days. Preliminary UNL work suggests that inulin can be extracted from dried chicory. With the U.S. Chicory drying facility, extraction of inulin from dried chicory would expand the process to a 12-month operation, reducing capital inputs and positioning U.S. Chicory as a low cost producer of inulin. Definition of extraction parameters in the proposed research will help design an efficient inulin extraction facility. Our Phase II proposal will refine purification and preservation strategies and develop a pilot-scale inulin processing facility. Extracting inulin from dried chicory will extend the processing season and reduce the capital investment to construct and operate the factory.

We propose to develop a novel cancer therapy using allosteric reagents for concentrating a prodrug around a target cancer cell. Our aptamer-based design, called a CLAMP (cis-linked aptamers for medical or microanalytical procedures), is a nucleic acid with two functionalities with which one can develop allostery. When an allosteric CLAMP binds one of its two targets, it is activated to bind its second target. The activated aptamer can then bind an imaging agent or a therapeutic agent. The property of allostery ensures that the therapeutic agent is only concentrated in locations of high expression of the first CLAMP target. This minimizes the effect of nonspecific interactions that would cause systemic toxicity if the therapeutic agents were directly linked to the CLAMP. Thus, the allosteric CLAMP is expected to be highly selective for the target cells.   
The allosteric CLAMP will be developed to target metastatic prostate cancer cells and will be designed to require two characteristics of these cells. These characteristics are high expression of prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) and high expression of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) protease. The allosteric CLAMP will be designed to bind inulin only when it is bound to PSCA. The inulin can be derivatized with a peptido prodrug that is designed as a specific substrate of PSA, which cleaves it to release a toxic agent such as doxorubicin or thapsigargin. The requirement for a combined presence of PSCA and PSA should provide the therapy with high selectivity.  
Because the allosteric CLAMP will link the cancer cell surface to inulin, the CLAMP-mediated therapy can be seamlessly interfaced with imaging technology by labeling the inulin with a contrast agent such as Tc99m. Being a small nucleic acid, the CLAMP will more readily penetrate solid tissues than will monoclonal antibodies, which are the currently used technologies for selective cell targeting. Thus, we anticipate this technology will provide higher selectivity and higher efficiency of killing prostate cancer cells than current therapies."

Detection and treatment of cancer can be greatly facilitated by noninvasive in vivo imaging techniques. In vivo imaging methods are most effective if they can be seamlessly tied to therapies. We propose to develop a novel imaging system using allosteric aptamers that can be used alternately to concentrate either an imaging agent or a drug around a cancer cell.   
  
Our aptamer-based design is referred to as a CLAMP (cis-/inked aptamers for medical or microanalytical procedures). CLAMPs provide the basic structure for developing allosteric aptamers in which the binding of one aptamer target to the CLAMP results in activation of another aptamer that is located in another part of the CLAMP molecule. The second, activated aptamer can then bind an imaging agent or a therapeutic agent.   
  
Because of HER2, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, is highly expressed in many cancers, it will be the target for evolving a new aptamer by SELEX. The selected and optimized HER2 aptamer will be used as the allosteric aptamer in the CLAMP. Thus, binding of HER2 to the cell surface will activate the second aptamer that binds the imaging agent which is attached to a polymer such as inulin.   
  
The allosteric CLAMPs are expected to provide the following advantages for imaging: 1) relatively rapid renal clearance due to the small size of the DNA and 2) slow release rates from the target cells. Release rates are an inverse function of the valency. The availability of more than one closely located CLAMP on the cell surface will create multivalent regions for binding to the targeted imaging agent, resulting in slow release rates.  
  
Because the CLAMP will link the cancer cell surface to another molecule, the CLAMP imaging technology can be seamlessly interfaced with peptide prodrug therapies in which the peptide substrates of proteases are degraded to release a toxic drug. The high concentration of proteases that surround metastatic cancer cells, combined with the ability of the CLAMP to concentrate the prodrug around the cells, will result in more effective therapies that are seamless with imaging."

Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) is an emerging technology for chemical separation that provides a multiplicative increase in separation capacity over traditional GC.  With this greatly increased performance, GCxGC generates data in significantly larger quantity and with significantly greater complexity.  The quantity and complexity of GCxGC data makes human analyses of GCxGC images difficult and time-consuming and motivates the need for automated processing.  This Phase I project undertakes both experimental and theoretical investigations into automating the process of matching observed patterns of chemical separations against previously recorded patterns annotated by human experts. The goals are to determine promising statistical models for GCxGC pattern matching and to demonstrate the feasibility of automated recognition. In this Phase I work, important anticipated results include statistical characterization of pattern variations and warping in GCxGC images, a catalog of useful annotations of previously observed pattern templates, and development of a prototype algorithm for automated pattern recognition. Phase I results, characterizing GCxGC patterns, cataloging annotations, and demonstrating the feasibility of automated processing, will provide a foundation for Phase II research aimed at developing commercially sign cant GCxGC methods.
This research has high potential impact for a variety of applications.  Commercial applications of GC include analyses of petroleum, environmental samples, foods and beverages, fragrances, and toxins (e.g., chemical warfare agents).

The development of multiplexed sensors capable of detecting any known biological warfare agent will be essential to rapidly implement measures to protect the population and military personnel from biological attack. The goal of this proposal is to develop an ultraminiaturized, sensitive biological warfare agent detection system. BioForce's NanoArray chip technology is based on affinity capture of pathogens using solid phase antibody arrays and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Antibodies to bacteria or viral pathogens are deposited in an addressable array on a solid surface of a chip. Binding of bacterial spores or viral particles to antibodies in defined spatial domains on the chip are detected by direct observation, using AFM, of a topographic change at that address, and the pathogen identity thereby determined. The advantage of our technology is that it has the potential to directly detect bacterial spores, such as anthrax, without any sample preparation and determine the number of spores in a sample, rapidly, accurately and with high specificity. We have already provided proof of principle that our technology can detect viral pathogens. We propose to adapt this technology to detect biological warfare agents. In these phase I studies, we will develop a NanoArray composed of antibodies against surface antigens that can detect simulants of biological warfare agents such as B. globigii and MS2 bacteriophage. Chemistries will be developed to attach these antisera to chip surfaces using similar procedures as we have employed to attach antibodies on chip surfaces to capture viral particles. We will use AFM to detect simulant binding to antibodies on the NanoArray. The sensitivity, reaction kinetics and specificity for AFM detection will be determined for each simulant alone, in combination or in the presence of other bacteria or viruses. The assay will be optimized for quantitation of pathogens. If these studies are successful, then in future studies (Phase II SBIR), we will develop a NanoArray/AFM system to detect all known biological warfare agents which can serve as a general sensor to protect the public and military personal from bioterrorism."

The device will also provide, either in conjunction with control or simply as a driver-alert system, individual monitoring of proper nozzle operation. Often, drivers cannot see all spray nozzles on a large boom or they are fully engaged in driving a wide, fast-moving vehicle over rough terrain. Individual nozzle communication will be achieved using current CAN bus systems which are commercially used on spray application vehicles. This research effort will initially focus for techniques for reliable, low-cost, robust flow sensing and actuator monitoring. Pressure, acoustic, vibration and vortex-shedding techniques will be investigated with spray nozzles. Potential interference from vehicle noise, vibration and electrical emissions will be determined. Signal processing requirements for low-cost sensors will be determined. At-nozzle microprocessor requirements for communication, sensor signal analysis and actuator control and will be determined. The results from Phase I will be used in Phase II to design a prototype system and implement it on commercial sprayers."

The project will develop an innovative approach to educational computer games. The approach will create a high-impact game that is as engaging and entertaining as computer games created purely for entertainment, but will also create the game so that it provides significant educational value. High-impact, engaging qualities will be achieved through game techniques including the use of virtual reality and other sophisticated multimedia tools. Educational value will be achieved by setting the game in a universe that accurately reflects aspects of the real world related to cancer and by exploiting features of game architecture that require the player to explore, experiment, and learn this real-world content in order to be successful playing the game. The final product will be field tested to measure learning effectiveness and appeal to youth. The timeline should have more detail to evaluate successful integration of the many proposed components.  
PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:
The result of the research is a learning game that will be marketed in two ways: 1. With lesson plans for use in the classroom, and 2. With a different introduction and different packaging for use outside the classroom. An indirect commercial application involves reuse of the high-impact game framework for the development of other high-impact learning computer games related to science and health."

Aeroelastically tailored blades constructed of braided carbon and hybrid carbon/glass composite materials offer the potential for significant savings in blade weight and possibly cost while using passive twist-bend coupling to ameliorate peak extreme loads and fatigue.  This project will develop and demonstrate the production of a utility-scale twist-bend coupled blade (with the desired fatigue characteristics) that can be cost-effectively manufactured using recently developed manufacturing methods (e.g., resin infusion molding) with braided carbon materials.  Phase I will include (1) material design and fatigue testing to identify structurally sound laminate constructions for effecting aeroelastic coupling using carbon and hybrid fiber reinforcements; (2) the identification of technologies for fabricating carbon and hybrid carbon/glass composite structures to effect aeroelastic coupling; and (3) the optimization of the carbon composite rotor blade design to 37-m wind turbine rotor blade (optimizing among the variables aeroelastic tailoring, stiffness, weight and cost reduction, load reduction, and aerodynamic performance) that provides the greatest reduction in cost of energy from wind power.                            Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  A family of designs for carbon composite aeroelastically tailored wind turbine blades, with lengths from 37 m to 60 m, should allow turbines to continue expanding in size while reducing the cost of energy by 8-10%.  This should enable a substantial expansion of wind energy markets in both the U.S. and Europe."

One of the main factors limiting the effectiveness of this technology is the problem of accurately assessing the input requirements of the field. In the most common approach, soil samples are acquired on a 2.5 acre grid pattern, sent to a laboratory for analysis, and various interpolation methods are applied to the sample results in order to predict the values for the entire field. Studies have shown that soil properties often have spatial variability greater than 2.5 acres, however the costs of sampling and lab analysis preclude denser sampling. A promising approach to this problem is to use devices that measure soil properties on-the-go more intensively than 2.5 acres/samples. One such sensor was prototyped by Purdue University for sensing soil pH. It demonstrated that soil pH could be successfully measured in-situ using combination, ion-selective electrodes. For this device to be viable, research must be conducted to create a soil sampling mechanism that can acquire soil in a wide variety of soil conditions and at commercially acceptable operating speeds."

Soil carbon measurements are needed to study carbon sequestration and measurements of soil nitrogen could be used to manage and minimize the leaching of nitrates into the ground water. Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy is an optical method that has shown good results in the laboratory for measuring soil carbon, soil nitrogen and other soil constituents. If this method could be applied in-situ without substantial loss of measurement accuracy, then a rapid field analysis of soil would be possible. Previous attempts have used designs that were prone to interference from dust and mud. This research proposes a method of performing in-situ optical measurements through a sapphire window. The sapphire, which has good optical qualities and is extremely durable, is pressed against the soil to maintain a smooth and consistent sample geometry. The window will be used to measure soil spectra in both a stationary mode and a non-stationary mode. Multivariate statistical analysis will then be used to correlate the spectra to levels of various soil constituents including carbon and nitrogen. These results will be compared to a similar analysis of spectra acquired in the laboratory."

An key advantage of single-molecule sequencing is the elimination of cloning and the laboratory
infrastructure associated with high-throughput operations. This, along with reduced reagent consumption, results in sequencing costs orders of magnitude lower compared to existing methods. Read lengths will be tens of kilobases to simplify shotgun sequence assembly and preserve haplotype information. Applications include whole-genome sequencing, SNPs, haplotyping, genotype-trait associations, long-read SAGE for expression profiling, analysis of alternative mRNA splicing patterns, and comparative genomics within or between species.

Two limitations to the use of SSR in plants are 1) the low frequency by which it occurs and 2) the difficulty in delivering enough DNA to produce a desired recombination event. Phytodyne Inc. proposes to overcome these limitations through the use of transposable elements. Excision of DNA transposons increases SSR more than 1000-fold, thereby overcoming the inherently low frequencies of homologous recombination in plants. cDNA generated by retrotransposons - transposable elements that replicate by reverse transcription-is highly recombinogenic. Retrotransposons can be modified to carry any sequence of interest and to synthesize cDNA at high levels. Every plant cell, therefore, can be converted into a 'cDNA factory' to overcome limitations of DNA delivery. This proposal seeks to use retrotransposon cDNA to correct defective marker genes by SSR. Among the marker genes tested will be those from which DNA transposons are actively excising to increase recombination frequencies. Completion of these experiments will provide the foundation for a transposon-based, site-specific recombination system for altering gene sequences from a variety of important crop species."

Composite projects, designed to replace metal, concrete, or wood, especially large projects such as bridge decks, regularly fail when it comes to cost analysis. The composites industry, for fifty years, has relied upon end-grain balsa wood core, due to its strength and low weight, as the material of choice. Balsa average 9 lbs/cubic foot density whereas other woods are 30 lbs. cu. ft. and up, the kenaf inner fiber is seven to eight lbs/cubic foot and a fraction of the price of balsa. A Kenaf-based core provides ""balsa-like"" inner fibers, and when the sticks are pressed and borded they become a very strong ""end-grained"" block. The resulting core appears to be stronger than balsa in compression and ""core-shear"" due to the smaller diameter sticks. Core shear is the all-important test when one evaluates the dynamic behavior of a composite sandwich cored structure, and load-carrying ability in compression determines the overall strength of the sandwich-cored part.

However, due to limited oral absorption, current embodiments of creatine dietary supplements require the administration of large doses that often result in undesired side-effects such as bloating, cramping and diarrhea.

These activities range from very basic activities such as transporting supplies to very sophisticated activities such as prepping patients. With proper training, unlicensed assistive personnel can be very competent caregivers. Healthcare facilities in rural areas have a particularly difficult time recruiting healthcare professionals and rely heavily on unlicensed assistive personnel. In rural areas the unlicensed assistive personnel do not have access to special training programs delivered by education department personnel in large urban medical centers. As a result nurses in rural healthcare facilities have to dedicate large amounts of their time to train new hires. This take time away from patient care and is costly for the health care facility. The proposed research project would develop and test an Internet-based training program for unlicensed assistive personnel in rural areas. In Phase I, a prototype-training module for ""Nursing Assistants"" will be developed and tested with newly hired personnel at Sioux Valley Hospitals and Healthcare System and the Good Samaritan Society.

U.S. suffer blinding corneal disease not amenable to conventional keratoplasty.
The improved keratoprosthesis (KPro) may restore functional vision for these
people, and is the basis for a significant demand supporting commercialization.
This Phase I project involves developing an improved thinner KPro of PMMA that,
with a significant innovative process, can be more securely fixated to a donor
cornea for use as a standard graft.
The measurable goals are:
1) developing a KPro production methodology to produce powers within +0.5D
accuracy;
2) demonstration of the fusion of front and back flanges with a narrow gap of
0.5-0.7mm with strength of 50 Newtons;
3) an independent laboratory determination of bioburden and ethylene oxide
sterilization validation, and toxicology testing.
Reaching these endpoints will permit processing directly to a Clinical Trial in
Phase II project under FDA Guidance Document for Keratoprostheses.
Tamcenan Corporation, and the Principle Investigator have experience in
developing and securing regulatory clearence and comericalization of ophthalmic
implants. Engineering & Ophthalmic Services has experience in devising
manufacturing protocols for contact lenses and Kpros. Geneva Laboratories, Inc.
is a full service certified testing laboratory that follows accepted protocols
for required tests.

PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The estimated 4 to 8 thousand patients in the U.S. yearly that cannot be adequately served by standard keratoplasty or existing KPros form a significant market for commercialization of a product that costs between $500.00 and $1000.00.  The participation of Eye Banks in this project will aid distribution and increase rewards for those participating."

We will continue to develop a novel system for high performance illumination, patterned in time and space. We will refine and fabricate a system for high performance data acquisition and processing, designed to support real-time confocal imaging. We will extend, further develop, evaluate and validate both static and adaptive algorithms used to reconstruct confocal images from a time series of spatially sub-sampled images. We will integrate component systems, to produce two configurations of the instrument. Phase III work will include development of documentation and a beta test program. The confocal systems developed with SBIR support will allow the collection of high quality confocal images in fluorescence, reflectance and transmission modes with equipment that can be inexpensively retrofit to existing microscopes, and will enable important new application."

Newphysical phenomena and properties begin to dominate as the device size scale approaches the wavelength of the light they emit, transmit, and detect.  In this realm, quantum nature of  light dominates, enabling more efficient and fast devices. Themicro-size lasers and LEDs allow the ability to create arrays of individually controllable pixels on a single chip.  Potentially these micro-size light emitters can operate as large arrays or independently to communicate millions of messages (or images) atthe same time.  Such vast numbers of micro-lasers could be used to read, write or process two-dimensional images, and to speed the flow of information between memory and processing chips as well as between different computer boards.  Micro-cavity lasersbased on III-nitrides offer additional benefits including shorter emission wavelengths (higher optical storage density and resolution), the ability to operate at much higher voltages and power levels due to their mechanical hardness and larger band gaps,and high speed due to the intrinsically rapid radiative recombination rates.  The objectives of this Phase I research are to further develop the III-nitride micro-cavity photonic device technologies and to demonstrate the feasibility for achievingelectrical pumped microcavity lasers as well as the integration of miniaturized light emitters with waveguides.III-nitride microdisk and microring lasers and arrays developed here are not only useful in compact displays, but also useful as emitters forremote free space functions and in short distance optical communication and high resolution and high speed optical links.  By combining millions of the laser beams of these micro-lasers together, one may also obtain extremely high power lasers with verysmall size and simple designing. When an array of III-nitride microcavities is reverse biased, it can be modified as a miniaturized UV detector array.  Thus III-nitride microcavity photonic devices open many important applications such as opticalcommunications, signal and image processing, optical interconnects, computing, enhanced energy conversion and storage, chemical- and biohazard substances and weapon detection and warning and medical.  III-nitride LED technologies will pave the way for fullcolor displays and mixing three primary colors to obtain white LEDs for general lighting.  The P.I.s have already developed a novel LED architecture that utilizes microdisk cavity LEDs and can boast the emission efficiency by more than 60%.

 novel inhibitor of methane formation in ruminant animals. Currently, monensin,     
 a relatively nonspecific antibiotic, is widely used in the livestock industry.     
 Monensin increases agricultural productivity by decreasing methane and             
 increasing propionate production; however, it also inhibits acetogenesis, which    
 is a beneficial process for the animal. We will target a specific biosynthetic     
 enzyme that catalyzes an essential step for survival of methanogenic microbes,     
 which are members of the kingdom Archaea, yet is not present in eukaryotes or      
 bacteria. A specific methanogenesis inhibitor would have the benefits of           
 monensin on increased productivity without the detrimental effect of               
 antiobiotic use. It should have significant market value. The immediate            
 projected use would be on feedlot cattle, pigs, and sheep. Such an inhibitor       
 could also be used to decrease methane production in the human Gl tract. Since     
 domesticated livestock is the largest global source of methane, inhibiting         
 methanogenesis by ruminant animals has the potential of mitigating the             
 greenhouse effect. Our plan is to synthesize and characterize inhibitors of the    
 biosynthetic enzyme that arrest methanogenesis at a concentration of 10            
 micromolar or lower.  

PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:
We plan to develop an inhibitor of methanogenesis that would replace monensin, which is widely used on feedlot cattle. If one considers the use of an inhibitor only on feedlot cattle, an estimate about $1.7 billion dollars can be made. Currently, the cost of monensin (rumensin) use in the US alone is $383 million."

 pharmaceutical, and human health screening technologies has challenged the         
 analytical sciences to create methodologies for high-sample throughput. Of the     
 many possible methodologies, capillary electrophoresis (CE) has an unrecognized    
 potential to serve as a platform for a highly multiplexed analysis system that     
 allows for extremely high sample throughput. However, CE traditionally suffers     
 from unacceptably high sample-to-sample and capillary-to-capillary variations      
 in elution profiles and injection volumes. This variability is one of the main     
 impediments to the use of CE in routine analysis. Furthermore, today's             
 multiplexed CE systems are based only on fluorescence read-out concepts, which     
 are ineffective in detecting -90 percent of the likely target compounds. This      
 project describes the design fabrication, and implementation of a 96-capillary     
 array CE system that 1) employs an absorbance-based read-out methodology and 2)    
 utilizes the near-continuous measurement, collection, and application of the       
 current flow at each individual capillary. The former significantly expands the    
 scope of the system. The latter uses the collected current for                     
 self-normalization of the electropherogram through application of the migration    
 index, which can yield precisions that compare favorably with that of high         
 performance liquid chromatography. Success in Phase I will lead to a Phase II      
 program focused on optimizing the system and methods to test biological fluids     
 to perform disease diagnosis and/or prognosis as well as combinatorial drug        
 synthesis and activity screening. Phase II would accumulate in actual field        
 tests being performed and compared to traditional, accepted methods.               
 PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:
 The ultimate goal of the project for commercial applications is the creation of a packaged
 system that has proven capabilities for solving problems in the health-related applications
 (e.g., cancer gene detection, multation analysis, forensic genotyping and drug efficacy)
 and other areas demanding reliable, high throughput analysis."

CE has the potential to function as a platform for a high- throughput analysis system, but suffers from unacceptable variations in migration times and injection volumes. Furthermore, today's multiplexed CE systems use fluorescence detection only, which without labeling is ineffective in detecting ~90% of all known compounds. This project proposes the fabrication and validation of a 96-capillary array CE system that employs 1) absorbance-based detection, and 2) current measurement in each capillary. The former eliminates the need and problems with fluorescence, significantly expanding the scope of multiplexed CE. The latter uses the collected current to reduce migration time and injection volume variability to the levels required for routine analytical work. Success in Phase I will lead to a Phase II program in which the analysis system will be optimized and protocols for peptide mapping and combinatorial synthesis will be developed and standardized.
Potential commercial applications of this project are in markets needing high throughput screening methods. Target customers for the technology include fine chemical makers that use combinatorial techniques to develop new catalysts and other materials, pharmaceutical firms that conduct high-throughput screening in drug discovery for the development of pharmaceutical compounds, biotechnology companies that utilize peptide mapping for the rapid fingerprinting of proteins, and clinical and forensic laboratories that require high-throughput screening to analyze samples and develop evidence in criminal investigations"

 care and a bridge to transplantation for patients with chronic liver diseases, and improve the
 prognosis of patients with acute liver failure, avoiding altogether the need for transplantation.

This technology is also expected to provide the capability for 'hands-free' control of computers and other electronic equipment for all users who may be using their hands for other tasks (such as typing, driving a motor vehicle, operating test equipment, etc.). This project focuses on recognition of multiple head and face gestures using standard low cost digital video cameras (under $100) and standard personal computers. The system may also be implemented on pocket computers for mobile and in-vehicle applications. Face and head gestures are used to generate mouse or keyboard actions to control a computer or to control signals that in turn control other types of electronic devices. For example, one application is the capability to 'surf the web' hands-free using head gestures to navigate web pages, including selecting and activating desired links. Gesture recognition can be used to replace or augment existing switch interfaces or expensive eye/head tracking systems for people with disabilities, and it has a number of advantages over voice recognition in many applications.
Early customers for this technology include computer users with mobility impairments who cannot effectively use a standard keyboard or mouse. Other commercial applications include hands-free control of desktop computer software such as web browsers or text-to-speech, and hands-free control of in-vehicle information systems and personal digital assistants (PDA's). The technology may also be applied for highly reliable hands-free control of industrial, scientific, or military equipment."

Currently, many rural schools design their school bus routes by acquiring a school district map, placing a stickpin on the where each student lives, and then creating the bus routes with string connecting the stickpins. In the 1997/98 school year, Nebraska schools spent almost $60,000,000 on transportation costs alone. At the same time that transportation costs have risen, rural schools have consolidated to form larger districts in order to survive and still serve the public. Some of these large school districts require buses to travel hundreds of miles each school day. Phase I research would identify the transportation needs of rural schools and develop a bus routing model for the Geographical Information System (GIS) to meet those needs. This model would allow the schools to design the most efficient routes, thus reduce fuel consumption and emissions. In addition, the safety of the children will be increased because GIS will identify dangerous spots, like railroad crossings, turn-arounds, and hazards intersections. If transportation costs could be reduced, rural schools would save millions of dollars each year."

needed to support a new approach to single molecule DNA sequencing. Single
molecule methods can be applied to DNA isolated directly from a subject
organism, eliminating the need to clone, map and sort DNA fragments prior to
sequencing. The need for electrophoretic separation is eliminated and reagent
consumption is minimal. Single molecule detection has been developed and
practiced by physicists and chemists for over 10 years. The crucial optical and
detection systems needed for single molecule sequencing now exist. To implement
this technology, novel nucleotides labeled at two different atomic positions
have been synthesized and tested as substrates for DNA polymerases. Whereas
some enzymes utilize nucletides labeled at the first position and other enzymes
utilize nucleotides labeled at the second position, we could not identify any
natural polymerase able to efficiently incorporate nucleotides labeled at both
positions (double-labeled nucleotides). In Phase I, we will develop methods for
the directed evolution of DNA polymerases adapted to the utilization of
double-labeled nucleotides. Directed evolution will be used in Phase II to
select for highly processive DNA polymerases having the desired substrate
specificities.

Detection of decayed poles help ensure the reliability of this service as well as help ensure the safety of linemen and the public. Currently used field methods for decay detection have proven useful for detecting only advanced stages of decay. Even then, poles with advanced decay are missed by trained inspectors more often than realized. Further consider, if trained pole inspectors make all too frequent errors, what is to be the anticipated error rates for utility line workers with less experience in pole inspection- people who work on these poles often during bad weather at all hours. The proposed effort is directed at determining the feasibility of detecting decay earlier in the field via micro-toughness testing.

Two prodrugs of each of two linear RGD-peptidomimetics currently on the market or in late stage development as intravenous products will be synthesized using two distinct linker technologies. Based on the results of these studies, a lead candidate will be identified for potential commercial development as an oral antithrombotic agent. There has been tremendous progress in the development of RGD- peptidomimetic derived antithrombotic agents. Administration of these agents is limited to intravenous routes due to poor oral bioavailability resulting from physicochemical properties unfavorable to cell membrane permeation. The low membrane permeation of RGD- peptidomimetics results from their size, charge, solubility, hydrogen- bonding potential, enzymatic stability and conformation. The cyclic prodrugs change these properties to increase their ability to permeate membranes. The prodrugs transiently mask the charge and hydrogen- bonding potential, improve the enzymatic stability and induce folding of the molecule to form a compact structure. After crossing the intestinal mucosa, the cyclic prodrugs are hydrolyzed by esterase to release the parent compound, which is then available to elicit its pharmacological action. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: All currently marketed RGD-peptide based antithrombic agents are administered via intravenous injection. The success of this research will enable the development of a new class of orally active antithrombic agents for cardiovascular disease management. With the data provided by the in vivo studies proposed, ProQuest intends to actively market the rights to license and practice the cyclic peptide technology to multiple pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for antithrombic and other indications."

Two significant barriers that currently pose obstacles for this producer group are the lack of local, qualified poultry processing plants and a steep learning curve in marketing through retail supermarkets. This project will examine key issues in developing an integrated production/processing/marketing program for pastured poultry raised on small family farms. Specifically, it will 1) outline the requirements for modifying existing small meat processing plants or erecting new buildings and outfitting them for processing poultry to State and federal inspection standards, 2) prepare a product cost analysis, including production, processing and distribution costs, and 3) evaluate retail consumer feedback and willingness to pay for the product to gage demand and price.

In short, this work will demonstrate the most highly intensified (high yield per volume per time) fatty acid reaction system ever developed. The importance of this study is two-fold: 1) the high intensity reaction system will allow significant reductions in capital investment for producing fatty acid derivatives, and 2) the no-catalyst strategy based on use of free fatty acids will allow use of formerly waste feedstocks, a net reduction in raw material costs, and a net increase in overall fatty acid resource utilization. This means more fatty acid derivatives available at lower cost, whether for industrial chemical products or for fuels. It also means that smaller processing facilities can be economically sited in conjunction with rendering plants, oil seed processing facilities, and waste oil recovery operations.

In this project, the precise point-of-use energetics of ACIM-powered microbubbles are applied to the important problem of removingradar absorbing materials (RAM) from aircraft surfaces.This phase-I project will lead to the development of an ACIM activated handheld sonifier for controlled in situ RAM decoating with no damage to the underlying metal/composite substrates.  Beyond theRAM removal task, this ACIM-powered tool will function as a universal decoater of broad applicability.  ACIM technology uses only silent sound and clean water.

CMP has become the method of choice for restoring the surface trueness of wafers at all stages of its manufacture. No method currently exists that can implement a CMP-safe slurry at the point of use. The proposed novel technology of acoustic coaxing induced microcavitation (ACIM) is a means to constructively control acoustic microcavitation and direct its high intensity energy implosions at specific particle sites. ACIM will achieve both the detection and destruction of the stray large particles and render the entire slurry CMP-safe at the point of use.

The project will use specially selected oregano from Eastern Europe that minimally meets quality standards when grown in the U.S. under a variety of production trials to rapidly identify system(s) to obtain high volatile oil yields and high total phenol content. Parallel studies will evaluate the best time to harvest oregano for maximum carvacrol content, and also to compare a wide range of high phenolic plants, including as alternative sources of oil. All essential oils will be chemically characterized using GC and GC/MS analysis and quality assurance protocols will be established.

The etiological agent is PRRS virus (PRRSV). Current attenuated vaccines against PRRSV are not totally effective in prevention of the infection and disease. In addition, there is emerging evidence that the current attenuated vaccines are not 100% safe due to reversion to virulence. A new generation of safe vaccines with a better performance will help in prevention of this disease. Most, if not all, viral vaccines protect via preexistent specific neutralizing antibodies. There is also strong evidence for a protective role of neutralizing antibodies in protection to PRRSV infection. We propose here to characterize neutralizing epitopes (mimotopes) for PRRSV using phage display libraries of peptides. To select the mimotopes we will take advantage of the characteristic features of porcine antibodies and the humoral response of swine to PRRSV infection. The capacity of these mimotopes to compete to neutralizing anti- PRRSV antibodies will be tested in vitro and selected ones will be used to induce a neutralizing antibody response as a proof of principle."

These probes are also expected to be a major improvement over current probes for applications such as the analysis of bacterial and other contamination of foods and in the analysis of specific gene expression in cell and tissue samples. We call these ""Targeted Revealed Aptamer Probes"" (TRAPS). The basic innovation in the proposed TRAP design is the inclusion of an attenuated aptamer that is revealed on hybridization with a target nucleic acid. In the current proposal, the following specific aims are proposed: *   Produce a basic TRAP probe. Determine that the TRAP probe only binds its ligand when the probe is hybridized with complementary RNA. Test for proportionality between the amounts of complementary RNA and ligand binding to the probe. Test for specificity of the interaction between the TRAP and the target RNA. *   Produce a capture TRAP probe that can be used in capture assays and test its efficacy. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Initially, these probes are expected to be a major improvement on the current nucleic acid probes used for detection of DNA and RNA sequences such as in the analysis of bacterial and other contamination of foods and in the analysis of specific gene expression in cell and tissue samples. After further development, the probes will be used for in vivo imaging of gene expression and for targeting cells in vivo so that they can be killed or remediated."

Iowa Thin Film presently manufactures ultra lightweight amorphous silicon solar cells using apolyimide web substrate for the terrestrial market.  Typical efficiency for the terrestrial product is approximately 5%.  Finished solar cells of this type are presently capable of a specific power of 750 W/Kg.  With a full focus on developing maximumefficiency for space use, laboratory results indicate that efficiency could approach 10%   Under this effort, ITFT proposes a systematic program to transition our existing production-based terrestrial flexible monolithic integrated a-Si to a low costspace-rated PV.  Since ITFT has already developed the core manufacturing processes of depositing on a flexible polymeric substrate and monolithic integration, we are in the unique position of being able to concentrate solely on the issues associated withconverting a low-cost terrestrial PV into a space PV.   The primary goal of Phase I is to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a new deposition process for a back surface reflection enhancing layer on our roll to roll fabricated, polymer baseddevices.In addition to lightweight power for space use, polymer based flexible photovoltaics have significant other DOD uses.

Power demands include command & control operations,  medical operations,lighting, chemical/biological filtering, and communications.   Iowa Thin Film Technologies (ITFT) manufactures a unique, flexible, thin film photovoltaic material on plastic which could be incorporated into the skins of military tentage to significantlyreduce this logistical burden.  ITFT's technology is a monolithically integrated module on plastic film manufactured using a roll-to-roll process.  These factors combine to give extreme flexibility, light weight, and durability while maintaining a lowmanufacturing cost.  This proposal addresses the R&D work needed to develop the technology for integrating the photovoltaic into tent skins without seriously compromising current tentage characteristics.

However, offsetting the many advantages of the AMB are its sensitivity to transient loads and the lack of a built in fail safe mechanism to capture the rotor and protect the FESS in the event of a system failure.  To meet this need MiTi has conceived and has tested two shock tolerant auxiliary bearings, the Zero Clearance Auxiliary Bearing (ZCAB) and the Powder Lubricated Auxiliary Bearing (P-LAB).  Each is suitable for high speed vacuum operation.  Under Phase I, MiTi will identify the design requirements for a vehicular class (e.g., the combat hybrid propulsion system) RESS shock tolerant auxiliary bearing designs to meet the design requirements, identify the required tribomaterial system (i.e, shaft material, bearing material and dry lubricant), select the bearing most suitable for Phase II demonstration and establish the development test rig concepts designs needed for Phase II.

In extending this development to the tactical jamming environment, specific challenges must be surmounted including estimation of signal amplitudes and compensation for deleterious amplitude and phase effects introduced by front-end spatial nulling. In its Phase I effort an enhanced amplitude estimation scheme for IDN will be developed, which will be evaluated in non-linear tracking simulations. TISI's simulator environment will be extended to include antenna pattern and vehicle blockage effects, as well as multiple jammer sources. A simplified model of spatial nulling disturbances will also be introduced. In preparation for RF testing of a prototype receiver in Phase II, MacAulay-Brown will develop a virtual GPS receiver environment concept for capture and playback of actual jammer and spatial pre-filtering scenarios produced by the AWFS. Finally, TISI will identify and compare options for implementing IDN in the GRAM-SAASM framework."

It is handles as pressurized liquid and difficult to meter accurately and dispense. Its low cost, due to inexpensive energy, has encouraged wasteful over-application rather than investment in currently costly and ineffective application control systems. Ammonia costs will increase with energy costs and environmental concerns over nitrates in ground water will motivate growers to more efficiently apply NH3.

This project will apply pulse-width modulation, already proven for liquid agrochemicals, to NH3 dispensing. Specifically, PWM control will maintain ammonia as liquid during metering and distribution across the tool bar. Additionally, a thermal recovery manifold will capture the cooling from the expansion downstream of the metering valves and cool the incoming ammonia. A simple electronic system and user interface will control the metering valves and monitor the thermodynamic state of the ammonia to assure accurate dispensing.

Based on Phase I results, the system is expected to greatly improve the uniformity of application across the tool bar boom and provide a much faster response and significantly wider range of application rates than existing technology. The system will be easily adapted to GPS and variable rate application."

As part of a monolithic optoelectronic technology, the thyristor is implemented as a vertical cavity device and is compatible with complementary HFET digital and analog electronics, with a complementary bipolar analog/digital gate configuration, and with vertical cavity lasers. The thyristor is based upon strained quantum well GaAs epitaxial growth with a natural emission frequency of 1 um. It is designed as a resonant vertical cavity detector with a three quantum well active absorbing region of about 300A and with current blocking barriers on either side resulting in detection which is highly resistant to radiation. With the absence of natural oxides in this structure, the HFET electronics is also radiation tolerant and implements high performance complementary logic because the natural threshold (+0.3V) are positive providing ample noise margins. The thyristor is unique in that it performs digital/analog detection in the off state and produces laser emission in the on state. By integrating with CHFET logic, a smart pixel may be designed to perform the functions of an emitter, modulator or detector depending on the logic levels applied to the resonant cavity device.

ORINCON's proposed research and development concentrates on the surveillance problem of high target density in a cluttered maritime environment.  Our effort focuses on robust data fusion for ISR through algorithmic adaptation. Our goals are to incorporate adaptive control of the fusion process in the baseline Contact Management/Common Module architecture; to develop a fuzzy controller to select fusion algorithms based on changing problem context; and to demonstrate the resulting context-dependent dynamic adaptation of the fusion system. The immediate benefits will include improved tracking and classification performance, increased modularity and portability between platforms, and expanded interfaces to additional sensors.

Target and background source spectra are separated using subspace projection procedures that include physical constraints. Advantages of this technique include computational efficiency, discrimination against noise and lack of a priori spectral assumptions. In Phase I we will create necessary data bases (tasks1, 2 and 5) to evaluate the approaches to atmospheric corrections (task 3) and the algorithms for sub-pixel target detection and identification (tasks 4 and 6).

Secondary recovery of sulfur, resulting from environmental regulation, produces more material than is needed by U.S. industry. The U.S. Bureau of Mines developed a process by which elemental sulfur can be used as a thermal cement with aggregate fillers to make concrete.  Sulfur concrete appears to be a good solution to solve the problem of deteriorating sewerage structures made from Portland cement.  Portland cement is alkaline and has been found to perform poorly in the acid environment in most sanitary sewer systems.  Alternative materials that can solve the problem of premature failure of concrete pipe are expensive.

Mayes ,,(316) 799-2763,,,,,,"The electromagnetic directed energy method (lasers, particle beams, and high power microwaves)  of defending against  missiles relies on generating a large amount of energy at the defense site, locating the target,  and then transporting a large fraction of that energy to the target along a line of sight at the speed of light, to either destroy or destabilize the threat at as long range as possible.    Cruise and sea skimming missiles are the most difficult target to intercept at long range with line of sight weapons, such as lasers, beam weapons, and high power microwaves because of the near earth operation.    Practical concerns require a hard kill, that is obvious destruction or destabilization of the target, rather than a soft target kill in which the guidance electronics or memory may be impaired, but invisible to the defense system. This proposal addresses these problems by establishing a long range defensive perimeter through delivery of a defensive package  to a point near the path of the target missile where the defensive package then generates a repetitive, high power, ultra-wideband, electromagnetic impulse or EM-UWB.      The EM generation package can be delivered to the target via inexpensive missile, projectile, or via a UAV.   This approach can be termed electro-magnetic flak or EM-Flak and greatly reduces the difficulties in targeting, and in covering a large defensive perimeter and can serve as the first line of defense.     These PROPRIETARY,  compact Marx circuits can also be installed permanently to form a long range EM-Flak fence around military installations.  Therefore, this proposal defines a PROPRIETARY, innovative,  compact, relatively inexpensive embodiment of a Marx circuit that has the power to deliver several hundred megawatts of impulse power at tens of kilohertz pulse rate.   The same Marx unit can be used as a defensive weapon on fighter aircraft,  a jammer on UAV or as the pollution treatment source of corona in modern automobiles."

It is handles as pressurized liquid and difficult to meter accurately and dispense. Its low cost, due to inexpensive energy, has encouraged wasteful over-application rather than investment in currently costly and ineffective application control systems. Ammonia costs will increase with energy costs and environmental concerns over nitrates in ground water will motivate growers to more efficiently apply NH3.

This project will apply pulse-width modulation, already proven for liquid agrochemicals, to NH3 dispensing. Specifically, PWM control will maintain ammonia as liquid during metering and distribution across the tool bar. Additionally, a thermal recovery manifold will capture the cooling from the expansion downstream of the metering valves and cool the incoming ammonia. A simple electronic system and user interface will control the metering valves and monitor the thermodynamic state of the ammonia to assure accurate dispensing.

Based on Phase I results, the system is expected to greatly improve the uniformity of application across the tool bar boom and provide a much faster response and significantly wider range of application rates than existing technology. The system will be easily adapted to GPS and variable rate application."

Long term measurements of the sequestration of carbon by vegetative and oceanic ecosystems are required on a wide scale to understand and quantify their role in the carbon balance of the atmosphere.  Such measurements require carbon dioxide sensors that are both accurate and robust.  This project will design and build an open path sensor for the measurement of carbon dioxide and water vapor that has the necessary response and resolution for measuring fluxes by eddy covariance.  This would allow the use of battery and or solar sources, give longer time between manintenance, and permit standardization of sensors.  In Phase I the necessary characteristics of such a sensor will be determined, the optics and electronics required to achieve or exceed those specifications will be designed, and a working test platform to verify the design will be built.

Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   Networks of sites are being formed around the world to measure fluxes of trace gasses above natural ecosystems.  This sensor would greatly enhance the viability and usefulness of these networks, by providing rapid, robust measurements of carbon dioxide and water vapor._"

Another approach to generating catalytic behavior will be to incorporate into the skin cream tertiary amine functionalities so that when the nanoparticles cause base catalyzed dehydrohalogenation of half mustard, mustard gas, or nerve agents, the liberated HCl or HF will be neutralized.

Feed costs account for 60% of the cost production and improving feeding program management can provide far reaching improvement in profitability.  Packing firms, who purchase and process pigs for consumption, financially penalize the swine producer if the weight of a pig is not within specified guidelines.  However, routinely weighing pigs is a laborious, time consuming task which can take away from other needed duties on the swine farm.

In order to claim total success of the product, mathematics and stress models need to be developed to predict the fatique life cycle and stress distibution of the composite/fastener assembly.  A series of shock and vibration tests need to be conducted to demonstrate fastener performances.The proposed self-locking fasteners have two major parts per set.  These two parts lock each other in the assembly after the pre-determined torque is set.  Under shock and vibration, the dynamic interlocking force is higher than the static locking force because of the unique design.  In addition, a stopper design is incorporated to prevent the interlocking force from being too high in dynamic condition.  The interlocking design ensures that the fastener stays intact even though the fastener may lose preload from the changes of composite thickness.  Airframe composite thickness may change due to lightning strikes, thermal expansion, water absorption, etc.These invented fasteners allow for loose tolerance holes, and provide efficient interface for high load transfer.  No special tools are required for assembly.  Standard thread forms are used on the fasteners.  For a self-locking nut design, a conventional bolt may be used.  The proposed fasteners requires no special drill tooling or pre-assembly fixtures.  All these features will save assembly cost significantly."

The problem is caused by the inability of these animals to hydrolyze raffinose and stachyoseinto galactose and fructose using endogenous digestive enzymes.  Consequently, soybean meal has alower metabolizable energy than would be expected based on a standard proximate analysis.  With thecurrent emphasis on plant genetic engineering to develop high energy grain, and a trend towards agreater reliance on plant-based nutrition due to concerns over Bovine Spongioform Encephalitis (BSE),improving the total nutritional value of soybean is an important target from an animal productionperspective.  To date, there are few examples of the use of supplemental enzymes for soybean-baseddiets.  The proposed research program would initially be focused on optimizing the use of an?-galactosidase to enhance the nutritive value of soybean in turkeys.

HGE has recently become recognized as a major tick-borne pathogen of humans in both the United States and Europe. Delays in diagnosis and treatment can result in increased morbidity and mortality, which has been estimated to be as high as 7-10% with elderly patients being more prone to both severe infection and death. Diagnostics tests for HGE are labor intensive, expensive and time consuming and results can be complicated by Co-infection of patients by the tick-borne pathogens of human babesiosis and Lyme borreliosis, or by other infections or autoimmune diseases. Because treatment for the various tick-borne diseases differs, and delays in treatment can lead to increased morbidity, there is a need for a good, rapid diagnostics tool for HGE. Immunodominant HGE antigens that are both sensitive and specific have already been isolated at Corixa by expression screening. The combination of these recombinants, an extensive serum bank, and a collaboration with a key investigator in the area of tick-borne diseases, should enable the goals and objectives of this proposal to be achieved."

High field magnets for the next generation of high energy particle accelerators demand new conductors that are capable of surpassing the presently available low temperature superconductors in terms of current capacity and cost effectiveness.  This project will evaluate a leading candidate for this application: a high temperature superconducting (HTS) wire based on chemical vapor deposition of thick films of the compound Yttrium-Barium-Copper on long lengths of textured metal substrates. The project should result in the development of a tape architecture suitable for testing for high field magnet applications.  Magnets based on this material could reduce the size and cooling requirements or increase the power of magnets for accelerator experiments.  In the Phase I program, one meter tapes of superconducting film based conductor will be baseline tested under temperature and field conditions pertinent to accelerator applications.  The substrate for the tapes will be based on the recently developed Rolling Assisted Bi-Axially Textured Substrate technology.  In addition, experiments will be performed to significantly enhance the current carrying capacity of the present film based conductor by producing short samples on textured nickel substrates with superconducting film thicknesses on the order of ten microns.  Means of adding stabilizer material for quench protection will also be explored.    Phase II will involve the long length fabrication of tape with the specialized architecture and testing in tape and coil configurations.

Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The high temperature superconducting tape developed under this project would have direct application in high field magnets for high energy accelerators.  The performance enhancements developed for this application will also provide very broad benefits to electric energy/power applications such as large industrial motors, transformers and generators."

Mortality and morbidity are primary sources of economic loss for poultry and livestock producers.  Control of morbidity and mortality has generally been accomplished through the use of vaccines and feed antibiotics.  In spite of these protective measures, livestock producers still suffer losses due to mortality and sub-clinical disease problems.  At least half of broiler mortality is due to unidentified factors.  It is therefore critical that the young chick's immune system has a strong start early in life.  The leucine catabolite Beta-hydroxy-Beta-methyl butyrate (HMB) has been shown to reduce mortality of broiler chickens, most of which was due to an abatement of unidentified early mortality during the first three weeks of age.  The objectives of this project would be to develop the use of HMB as an alternative to conventional drugs to control mortality in broilers.  The proposed study will use in vivo and in vitro techniques to determine if HMB improves immune function in young broiler chicks and thus, reducing unidentified mortality of the broiler chicks.

In the United States steel industry, the total annual electrical energy consumption by electric are furnaces (EAFs) is 16,000,000,000 kwh, at a cost of $600,000,000.  Currently, the primary source of thermal energy in EAFs is the electric arc (65% of kwh), with additional energy input from oxy-fuel burners (5%), and other exothermic reactions (30%) that are supported by injecting oxygen into the furnace.  Presently, energy input setpoint profiles are developed through trial and error, by simple linear algorithms, or are based on the experience of furnace operators.  This project will develop an intelligent system, based on neural network technology, that optimizes the energy input from each major source, automatically adapting to changing operating conditions.  In Phase I, an EAF will be outfitted with sensors to monitor furnace conditions, energy input, and furnace off-gas emissions so that more accurate neural-network models can be devised.  In Phase II, a working prototype control system will be developed to optimally coordinate energy input from each major source.  

Anticipated Results/Potential Commercial Applications as described by the awardee: A 5% improvement in energy efficiency could save the US steel industry $50 million per year.  Other benefits include greater flexibility to energy source availability and reduced emissions.  Commercialization will be accelerated by targeting our existing customers for upgrades to their EAF installations."

Pork producers have a desire to improve their efficiency of production in a cost effective manner.  One tool to accomplish this is knowing the weight of the pig as it grows.  This knowledge provides greater assistance in managing the feeding program as well as avoiding financial penalties when marketing.

Feed costs account for 60% of the cost production and improving feeding program management can provide far reaching improvement in profitability.  Packing firms, who purchase and process pigs for consumption, financially penalize the swine producer if the weight of a pig is not within specified guidelines.  However, routinely weighing pigs is a laborious, time consuming task which can take away from other needed duties on the swine farm.

Our approach is to develop an automated weighing system that will provide the swine producer the needed information to effectively manage the farm's feeding program and to identify which pigs would meet market weight guidelines to minimize financial penalties."

Genetics gains are being limited by the length of the GI, inefficiencies in new reproductive technologies, and the low rates of selection intensity of dams in production herds.  Multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) programs and transvaginal ultrasonically guided ovum pick-up (OPU) throughout the estrous cycle have been used to increase the selection intensity of dams.  The variability of superovulation and low rates of development of the embryos has limited the number of offspring produced and has had little impact on the GI.  Collection of oocytes from prepuberal heifers offers the best method for decreasing the GI but lack of developmental competence of the oocytes limits its use.  A more complete understanding of the temporal changes occurring in the nucleus and ooplasm during oocyte growth, maturation, fertilization and early development is essential to development of this technology.  The aim of the proposed studies is to develop efficient methods for collection of oocytes from the ovaries of gonadotrophin-stimulated prepuberal heifers by comparing effects of superovulatory treatments and the effect of donor age on cellular and functional changes occurring during maturation and IVMFC.

These assessment tools usually consider variabilities in site characteristics, target attributes like strength and stiffness, and weapon delivery charactenstics. Current vulnerability procedures are overly conservative in that, to ensure high confidence in sustaining the facilities' mission, they presume a ""worst-case scenano"" in the use of values for target strength or weapon CEP. The problem is compounded by the fact that the loading on a target is caused by a weapon environment whose effects on the target are highly variable, and where significant changes in some parameters can require a complete change in the vulnerability model. Our Phase I research objective is to demonstrate the powerful capabilities of an object-oriented framework approach, by building a software environment to conduct embedded simulation exercises for assessment. We will demonstrate the software environment by implementing into our framework two or three simple existing two-dimensional continuuncodes running on a single hardware architecture and integmted with one or two simple vulnerability codes ."

Having demonstrated that such 3-channel coding and 5:2 source code compression can be applied to 35-S dideoxy sequencing, experiments are proposed to improve the speed and efficiency of (i) multiplex DNA sequencing, (ii) PCR-based sequencing, (iii) automated multi-fluor sequencing, and (iv) automated multi-channel/single fluor sequencing.

The new approach is called SAM1 (for Semiempirical ab initia Method Version 1). SAM1 is different from present methods in that it explicitly computes two-electron repulsion integrals via a minimum Gaussian basis set, bringing new theoretical rigor to the NDDO model on which such successful techniques as AM1 and MNDO are based. Many of the aspects that make seimempirical methods so attractive and useful to such a wide audience (i.e. speed and implicit accounting for electron correlation) are retained in SAM1. We propose here to expand and apply the SAM1 method to a variety of new elements and to test its performance on the prediction of chemical phenomena. Parameter sets for carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I) have already been derived. We will expand this set of elements to sulfur (S), phosphorous (P), silicon (Si), arsenic (As), and copper (Cu), allowing SAM1 to be applied to a wide range of chemistry including the processes of life, materials science, and many reactions of industrial importance.

Delta wings with sweep angles of 60 degrees or more will be fitted with the proposed leading-edge device of 3 or more flaps. Each flap is controlled with a high-speed digital linear stepper motor and is capable of executing autonomous oscillations. It is intended to capitalize on excitation of helical instability waves of clockwise and counterclockwise spin on the separated leading-edge vortex to manipulate the pressure distribution along the vortex core. This in turn affects the location of vortex breakdown which could lead to enhanced lift and super-maneuverability of a delta or cropped delta wing aircraft. A parallel effort will be spent on incorporating piezo-electric oscillator/exciters on swept wing leading edges, which will dynamically manipulate camber distribution along the wing span in a 3-D fashion. With the proper choice of the driving frequency (i.e., nondimensional Strouhal number), a resonant flow behavior can be excited, which in turn eliminates the need for large-amplitude leading-edge oscillations. We currently estimate a maximum angular oscillation amplitude of +/- 5 degrees."

The American Innovation and Manufacturing Act authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to phase down production and consumption of refrigerants causing global warming by 85 percent over 15 years. The societal, economical, and environmental benefits are estimated to create thousands of jobs and increase manufacturing by billions of dollars in the U.S. while reducing venting and incineration, and subsequently global temperature rise. There are millions of metric tons of mixed refrigerants that cannot be reclaimed using current fractional distillation technology. The proposed ionic liquid extractive distillation technology will make possible the separation and reuse of these complex refrigerant mixtures. The startup company funded through this project will provide a novel separation technology to the refrigerant industry that is of strategic national interest. Outreach activities, especially toward the inclusion of women and underrepresented minorities will be supported through this project.

This STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate that complex, multi-component, azeotropic refrigerant mixtures can be separated using ionic liquids, and that the products can meet industry standard specifications. Refrigerant mixture R-404A, used broadly throughout the commercial refrigeration industry (e.g., grocery stores) is a complex, ternary azeotropic mixture containing HFC-143a (1,1,1-trifluoroethane), which has a high global warming potential. HFC-143a will be one of the first refrigerants to be reused in new low global warming blends containing hydrofluoroolefins if the HFC-143a can be economically separated. Over 100 complex, multicomponent refrigerant mixtures exist in the market. This project will enable the development of processes, technologies, and systems designs required for industry to meet and exceed the phase down goals. The program objectives include the separation of R-404A into components, the creation of a process model, and testing of recovered R-404A from industry to understand the effects of impurities. The results will be used to develop a technoeconomic model and commercial scale designs that the team will build and/or license to the refrigerant industry.

Widespread adoption of the sensor could support cost-effective and improved N fertilizer management, which may increase farmers’ productivity and profitability. Low-cost, instantaneous nitrate testing readouts from plant stalks will provide more actionable information to guide farmers’ fertilization decisions than current methods to test N levels in soil (e.g., collect soil samples, ship them to lab, and then wait ~1 week for lab analysis). The improvements in fertilizer-management decisions, enabled by more accessible and more actionable data, have the potential to reduce total N fertilizer applications in the US by some 2 million tons annually. This large reduction in N fertilizer applications would decrease the energy footprint of agriculture, reduce emissions of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas 300 times as potent as carbon dioxide, and improve water quality through reductions in N runoff, improving ecosystem services and human health through improved rural water quality and the reduction in hypoxic dead zones.

The proposed project represents an innovation in the function and application of an in planta nitrate sensor. The project goals are to: i) improve the sensor for reliable deployment in field measurements; ii) conduct research in farmers’ fields to develop predictive models that input nitrate levels from sensor measurements of corn stalks and other data to output N fertilization recommendations; and iii) build a lab-based multi-probe nitrate sensor that extends the work to other crops in the existing plant and soil testing market. Anticipated results are that the data from the sensors will be used to build predictive models that output optimum N fertilization recommendations that will outperform conventional models. The accomplishment of this goal will lead to the commercialization of rugged low-cost sensors that provide rapid measurements of plant sap nitrate. This ability will make it possible to provide farmers with low-cost fertilizer recommendations based on data-driven, predictive modeling of N demand.

The downtime associated with such high productivity equipment can result in significant lost revenue, and research shows that the average manufacturer deals with 800 hours of downtime per year. The proposed technology seeks to effectively reduce or eliminate this downtime, creating value for manufacturers. This project proposes a novel deep learning approach to predicting bearing failure in rotating industrial equipment and enable maintenance teams to confidently plan optimal maintenance activities around equipment that is in the process of degrading. This solution also aims to cost-effectively use a patented methodology to monitor industrial material handling systems with a combination of stationary and mobile battery-powered wireless sensors.

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project proposes a novel deep learning approach to machinery prognostics. Many existing deep learning approaches focus on the most likely failure scenarios given a set of training data. Monitored equipment may not exbibit behavior covered in that training set, leading to low-confidence predictions. The proposed approach may not only predict the remaining useful life of a machine component, but also seeks to quantify the uncertainty of a prediction through an ensemble of models and a temporal fusion of predictions. As a result, maintenance decisions may be made from a risk-based perspective, eliminating unnecessary maintenance stemming from low-confidence predictions. Additionally, many existing deep learning approaches also lack the ability to intuitively explain their predictions to human users. In critical applications where poor predictions have serious consequences, maintenance personnel must understand and trust an artificially intelligent predictive maintenance partner. The proposed solution produces an intuitive visual explanation for the model’s prediction by highlighting and animating the segments of a raw data signal that are contributing most significantly to the prediction. This technology may allow trained personnel to quickly make optimal maintenance decisions by fusing data-driven insights with their existing domain expertise.

Innovations are sought that will improve Nuclear-Physics Scientific User Facilities and the wider community’s experimental programs. Passivation techniques or other surface treatments to Electron-Cyclotron-Resonance components are of interest to reduce contamination from heavy-ion-induced erosion of alloys used in the Electron-Cyclotron Resonance source.Key properties for the surface passivation layer include:
1) high secondary electron emission, 2) low heavy-ion erosion rate, 3) excellent adhesion to the metal substrate, 4) smooth surface finish, 5) chemical, thermal, and vacuum stability, 6) thermally conductive surface, and 7) ability to coat inside-diameter surfaces. Our research objective is to demonstrate a novel conversion-coating technology, Plasma Electrolyte Oxidation, to convert value-alloy (e.g., 6061 Aluminum) surfaces to crystalline aluminum-oxide (alumina) and mullite that will exhibit lower sputter yield than either pure Aluminum or bare 6061 Aluminum. This unique high-voltage anodizing method produces adherent, hard crystalline-oxides on value metals
/ alloys (e.g., Al, Mg, Ti, Zr, Ta). The method is an immersion non-line-of-sight method enabling it to treat complex shapes, consumes part of the underlying substrate resulting in excellent oxide adhesion, produces a harder surface than conventional “hard” anodize, uses environmentally- friendly electrolyte solutions, and can be doped with nanoparticles to improve oxide toughness / durability and reduce surface roughness. Our team has already converted several Al alloys (e.g., 3003, 2024, 6061, 7075 Aluminum), Titanium alloys (e.g., pure Titanium and Ti6Al4V), and Zirconium-alloys. We have also added oxide (e.g., alumina, zirconia) and conductive carbide (e.g., silicon carbide, boron carbide) nanoparticles to the electrolyte solution to reduce surface finish and increase toughness of the growing crystalline oxide. From the literature, alumina and magnesium- oxide exhibit a 76.5% and 90% reduction, respectively, in erosion rate when exposed to a 600eV Argon-ion plasma compared to bare Aluminum and Magnesium. Therefore, it appears these oxides will offer a longer-lifetime surface for Electron-Cyclotron-Resonance components. In Phase I, we will coordinate with candidate Department of Energy and University end-users to define components, alloys of construction, and desired oxide thickness. Converted Aluminum- alloy coupons will be prepared with selected electrolytes along with specific nanoparticles for oxide toughening for subsequent characterization and testing. Surface characterizations will include: 1) tape-peel and tensile plug bond-adhesion measurements, 2) surface finish measurements using Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy, 3) vacuum compatibility and Argon- ion erosion in a vacuum chamber (using weight change as the metric), 4) X-ray diffraction to determine the alumina, mullite phases formed, and 5) conversion-coating thickness, morphology, and composition using Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy. Down- selection of the best Plasma Electrolyte Oxidation parameters will be made in Phase I for recommendations for additional characterization in Phase II. This will include shipment of Plasma Electrolyte Oxidation processed coupons (e.g., extraction electrode) to Department of Energy or University Laboratories for screening in actual plasma / ion environments to provide a more realistic assessment of erosion-rate, adhesion, and lifetime. After these more realistic exposures, subscale or actual components will be processed by Plasma Electrolyte Oxidation to demonstrate application to Electron-Cyclotron-Resonance components. We will also survey the Nuclear- Physics community to learn about additional application areas, such as electron-ion collider and superconducting radio-frequency cavities, among other suitable components. Other application areas include wear and corrosion-resistant surfaces for components used in recreational and transportation vehicles, agriculture equipment, and components for military vehicles.Keywords: plasma-electrolytic-oxidation, crystalline aluminum-oxide, conversion-immersion, non-line-of-sight, ion-erosion, surface-finish, adhesion, toughness, complex-shapesSummary of Members of Congress: Demonstration of erosion-resistant oxide coatings on the internal surface of Electron-Cyclotron-Resonance source chambers will reduce contamination of sources thereby increasing the performance, reliability, and increase component lifetime.

Proposed coating materials must survive thermo-mechanical loading (e.g., no flaking or spalling) during exposure to the high-temperature conditions encountered during reactor operation and maintain metallurgical stability with no diffusion-induced composition changes or aging over extended time-durations. The objective of our research is to investigate a relatively new additive manufacturing method, Additive Friction-Stir Deposition, to deposit corrosion-resistant Ni-base alloys (e.g., Haynes 244, Hastelloy-N or others to be determined) onto specified materials in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. At the onset, we will consult with subject matter expert scientists for materials selection recommendations (including potential need for thermal-expansion buffer layer), candidate component geometries, sources for coupon-level liquid-salt exposures, and selection of hardware for Additive Friction-Stir Deposition demonstration in Phase II. This unique additive manufacturing method, being pioneered at a major United States University, exhibits several unique features, including: 1) deposition of millimeter-thick layers, 2) good coating adhesion thanks to plastic-deformation, material flow and mixing, and forging-action with the substrate, 3) low residual stress and low distortion, and 4) high build rate and good scalability. In general, this unique additive manufacturing process induces severe plastic deformation at elevated temperature which results in a uniformly recrystallized microstructure with minimal internal defects or porosity. Furthermore, the forged microstructure results in as-printed mechanical properties that are comparable to wrought material properties. Initially, flat-substrates will be processed with selected alloys to enable tooling and process-parameter development and to provide coupons for characterization and testing, which will include 1) Non Destructive Examination x-radiography for interface bond-integrity and defects/porosity characterization, 2) optical metallography as a complementary assessment of bond quality, defects/porosity, and microstructure; 3) x-ray diffraction for phase identification, 4) tensile testing to quantify the bond strength and failure mechanism (pre and post thermally annealed), and 5) corrosion/oxidation in high-temperature air. After development of acceptable Additive Friction-Stir Deposition material on flat surfaces, curved surfaces (representing a portion of a pipe, curvature to be determined) will then be printed to demonstrate application to complex-shaped surfaces. Preliminary characterization of Additive Friction-Stir Deposition processed curved surfaces will also be performed to assess the effects of curvature on the printed material.

In the USover 7 million Americans drink water from community water systems (CWS) that contain nitrate-
(NO ) at concentrations exceeding the maximum contaminant level (MCL). The go-to3
technologies for nitrate treatment from CWSs produce highly concentrated nitrate brine residualsand are limited by expensive brine disposal and management options. Further more than 35million acres of sub-surface drained land exist in the US and no technology has established asignificant market share that removes nitrate from agricultural drainage. Based on the scale ofnitrate contamination in community water systems and the growing need to reduce nitrogen loadfrom tile drainage the total addressable market for nitrate removal is sizable.Project Objectives: The main technical objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of a highlyefficient photocatalytic unit for the sustainable removal of nitrates from waste waters at a costlower than incumbent technologies. To achieve this goal the team will design novel particulate-
type photocatalytic heterostructures that will reduce nitrates to nitrogen upon illumination whileco-generating hypochlorite as a disinfectant. The team will also investigate the nitrate conversionmechanism of synthesized photocatalytic heterostructures and use the results to optimizephotocatalyst formulations further. The optimized photocatalytic heterostructures will then betested in a lab-scale fluidized bed reactor with different feed water chemistries. The final goal forthis Phase I project would be to achieve nitrate removal efficiencies exceeding 75% and stabilityexceeding 100 hours in accelerated testing conditions.Anticipated Results. At the end of Phase I Pani Clean Inc will have a small lab-scale nitratetreatment unit with nitrate conversion efficiencies exceeding 75% no brine disposal issues andcost less than $1.2 per 1000 gallons of treated water a four-to-five-fold decrease compared to theincumbent technologies.Potential Commercial Applications. The 1706 community water systems (CWS) experiencingrecent violations of nitrate levels primarily from agricultural practices represent the immediatelyaddressable market. The near-term application would be to treat nitrates at the edge-of-field andas POU nitrate treatment systems for individual residences with nitrate-contaminated private wells."

There are, however, few tools available to industry capable of simulating these flows at a resolution and scale suitable make predictions of adequate detail – at least within reasonable timeframes and budgetary constraints – to inform engineers and designers. A next generation, highly efficient simulation code is needed that can deliver results within useful timeframes (e.g., shorter run times, lower energy usage, economical), with sufficient detail (e.g., high- resolution, flow sufficiently resolved, engineering insight is gained) to be useful to support simulation- driven design, discovery and optimization. Furthermore, a code that has been designed to run on modern and emerging heterogeneous architectures (e.g., multi-node, multi-GPU), and can efficiently leverage these architectures though the use of numerical schemes designed to maximized computational efficiency (e.g., reduce communication between nodes, maximize use of GPU’s or other accelerators). We propose the integration of Synthetik’s commercial blastFoam software and the ASCR-funded MFEM libraries to deliver blastFEM - a GPU-accelerated, very high-performance and energy-efficient solver for highly compressible flows, including high-explosive detonation and airblast. During Phase I, Synthetik will: (1) build a GPU-accelerated compressible flow solver based on MFEM and (2) carry out preliminary feasibility studies to characterize solver performance and energy efficiency to compare with blastFoam CPU benchmarks. The impact of the work proposed herein would be substantial and provide a cross-cutting, step change in capability for American researchers, engineers, academics and scientists. Furthermore, we are proposing a highly innovative and immediately commercially viable product; and are proposing a to contribute back to the MFEM project a foundational application that other researchers and scientists can customize and use to study related phenomena of interest (e.g., compressible multiphase reactive and detonating flows). This will allow us to both exploit our unique position in the market as leaders in physics-based modeling and simulation of solid-state detonation, propellants, and airblast, while further enhancing the impact of this project by enabling others to more readily access and leverage the powerful MFEM project."

Science performed at DOE test reactors inspires future nuclear energy technology and requires more precise and localized instrumentation. Next generation nuclear reactors also benefit from higher precision, smaller, distributed instrumentation that can be mass produced for fuel and power monitoring.
Addressing the Problem: Here it is proposed to springboard on the strong MPFD development legacy to produce a viable configurable-commercial (C2-MPFD) that will help scientists and engineers continue to advance and implement nuclear fuel cycle and materials innovation. The C2-MPFD provides a per-customer solution for in-core neutron detection. C2-MPFDs are composed of a distributed array of small (~1-5 mm3) gas-filled chambers with fissile coatings, and the neutron reactive material can be tailored to the neutron energy regime of interest. These robust sensors will designed do withstand the high-temperature, high-pressure, high-radiation environment common amount test reactors and Gen IV reactors (SMRs, Micro-reactors, ISMRs). The specific aims of this project are (1) Evaluate current state-of-the-art of MPFD technology for redesign to improve manufacturability, reliability, and signal integrity, (2) design, develop, and demonstrate a high-throughput VLSI manufacturing capability for scalable MPFD production at low cost, and (3) solving reaming fabrication hurdles (e.g., chamber sealing) hindering full scall commercial production. A two-phase plan is proposed to accomplish this effort. In Phase I, C2-MPFD fabrication methodology for detector subcomponents will be demonstrated, specifically applying VLSI fabrication techniques and micromachining these hard ceramic-materials, raw-material supply-chain trade study, and C2-MPFD packaging for wide-range temperature operation. In Phase II, further work will be pursued to fully develop the C2-MPFD system, reduce its production-cost point, develop the readout electronics for the C2-MPFD. Phase II C2-MPFDs will be deployed and demonstrated at DOE National Laboratory Materials Test Reactors.
Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The scientific and commercial impact from the C2-MPFD is expected to be significant. The C2-MPFD instrument will directly impact the quality of nuclear reactor materials research and nuclear power research planned for many nuclear reactor facilities both government and privately owned. Additionally, the development of the novel C2-MPFD will benefit far reaching nuclear reactor applications like space power reactors being designed for long term flight and habitation missions. The small size of the C2-MPFD instrument is non-intrusive and will not cause flux depression or unwanted perturbations in the neutron flux, even for small reactors. Such applications would be the basis for a follow-on Phase III study. Technological advances of the C2-MPFD (and its VLSI manufacturing methods/processes) are needed to keep the US in the forefront of applications of science and engineering for the betterment of all society. The C2-MPFD will result in world-class advances at the cutting-edge of in-core neutron detector design and fabrication. Overall: The successful demonstration of the C2-MPFD technology will provide a new power-monitoring device for commercial and research nuclear-reactors extending to Gen-IV reactors. C2-MPFDs are central components to several ongoing DOE-sponsored projects. This effort will lead to improved quantification of reliability and uncertainty, which supports both current and future DOE work with MPFDs."

Spent fuel is loaded in these dry storage cannisters (DSC) which are typically welded, 5/8-inch-thick stainless steel that are then inserted for long term storage in metal or concrete overpacks. The DOE needs sensor solutions to periodically monitor the condition of the dry storage canisters to ensure that pre-identified safety regulations are being met.
Addressing the Problem: RDT proposes to study the feasibility of deploying a modified-Domino® to perform concurrent measurements of gamma-ray, fast neutron, and thermal neutron populations within the overpack vent chases. The modified-Domino would be affixed to a flexible wand and cart that travels the length of the vent and measures radiation dose as a function of axial position on the exterior of the cannister. A thermocouple could be attached to the cart as a supplementary sensor to log the DSC temperature profile. RDT proposes to use our commercially available standard MSND for thermal neutron detection and to modify the backfill material and microcavity geometry to make fast neutron sensitive and gamma-ray/x-ray sensitive detectors for this application. The MSNDs would be arrayed on the modified-Domino wherein the count rate for each MSND can be readout individually and logged. The Domino/MSND technology is well suited for this application due to its small size, low weight, and low power features. The Phase I period of performance will focus on proving the feasibility of a modified-Domino system to operate in the vent spaces of a DSC/overpack system and buildout of a low-fidelity detector prototype. In Phase II, the Team will focus on calibration, ruggedization, refinement, and deployment of a commercialized DSC inspection and monitoring system. RDT will work closely with manufactures, customers, and stakeholders of DSC systems to ensure our inspection systems satisfies the needs of all those involved in this complicated and important challenge of long term spent nuclear fuel storage.
Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The scientific and commercial impact from the modified MSNDs and Dominos is expected to be significant. Primarily, the detector is designed to perform radiological surveys in the harsh radiation environment between the spent nuclear fuel loaded dry storage cannister wall and the wall of the concrete or metal overpack to ensure the integrity of the storage system per DOE guidelines. Secondarily, the thermal neutron, fast neutron, and gamma-ray sensitive MSND/modified Dominos can easily be adapted to the wearable active dosimetry market due to its compact size, low weight, and low power requirements. Tertiarily, the modified MSND platform developed in the proposed work would allow for RDT to offer a 2x2 array of fast-neutron sensitive MSNDs on the Domino footprint, which has been a common product availability query to RDT over the past 5 years from potential and current customers. If successful, RDT could see immediate commercial sales spun out from the work performed in this proposal to satisfy fast-neutron detection needs."

Because SNF is being stored for longer periods than initially envisioned, the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy, Office of Spent Fuel and Waste Science and Technology is assessing the technical performance of the SNF storage systems after extended durations.
The concept of a sustainable geologic repository for SNF disposal relies heavily on the safety provided by multiple barriers, such as repository host rock, overlying rock formation, and man-made engineered barrier systems (EBS). One of the major components of EBS is bentonite-based buffer materials that isolate the nuclear-waste canisters from the host rock and fill up the void left in the horizontally drilled boreholes. The resaturated bentonite has a swelling characteristic, which is useful for self-sealing the microcracks in the host rock and supporting the heavy weight of the canister. However, factors such as nonuniformity in the saturation and swelling pressure of bentonite, and the high temperature at the canister-bentonite interface may lead to instability in the placement of waste canister inside the borehole. Therefore, evaluating the long-term deformation of bentonite-based material under complex thermo- mechanical loading conditions is necessary.
By using RESPEC’s experience in characterizing the time-dependent creep deformation of salt in its in-house, world-class laboratory and with minor modifications to the existing laboratory system, time-dependent deformation in bentonite-based materials can be better characterized. RESPEC proposes to conduct a series of creep experiments on bentonite-based specimens under low shear stress and high temperature conditions that improves understanding of EBS under typical repository conditions. The project also plans to develop and standardize an innovative laboratory testing program that will eventually be applied across scientific and engineering disciplines where an improved fundamental understanding behavior of clay and shale is required.
Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The systematic creep testing of bentonite-based specimens will help in developing a new standardized testing procedure that will be applicable for analyzing the similar characteristics of shale or clay like materials in different geologic conditions outside repository science, including in civil engineering and infrastructure projects, underground and open pit mining, and deep drilling."

This problem is caused by the high soldering temperature needed to make high-density interconnects in thin semiconductor chips using flip chip solder bump bonding technology. The size scales for the solder interconnects are not accessible via traditional low-cost solder printing or ball mounting but with a lengthy and costly bump bonding process to produce the small and precise solder bumps. Highly sensitive sensor pixels and high-density interconnects between readout and sensor chips are necessary for the continued advancement in medical and scientific instruments, but also of high energy physics and upgrades to facilities such as those at the Department of Energy and others. Large format chips have challenges forming and or keeping the flip chip interconnects joined at the device edge because of coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch causing dynamic warpage during the high temperature soldering process.
The problem of the high heat needed for soldering and the problem of precise placement of solder bumps is being addressed in this proposal by using solder metal microcapsules in a supercooled liquid state that are placed via a self-assembly process. The supercooled liquid state allows the application of liquid metal solder at temperatures dramatically lower than normal solder reflow temperatures. The objective of the multiphase project is to replace bumps on a readout application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) with a supercooled liquid metal microcapsule precisely placed via a simple and cost-effective self-assembly process. The supercooled liquid nature of the microcapsules will then enable solder reflow of a higher melting alloy, composed of SnAgCu, at lower temperatures than traditionally needed (=130 vs. peak reflow 250 °C) with high interconnect density and low edge defects.
The Phase I work plan covers the tailoring of previously developed supercooled liquid microcapsules of SnAgCu to the proposed self-assembly process by means of chemical surface coatings. These specialized microcapsules will be self-assembled into high density arrays on test vehicles designed to mimic the thickness, feature size, and interconnect density of readout and sensor chips. The test vehicles will then be interconnected at temperatures =130 °C and inspected for their quality and relevance to commercial and government interests. The resulting interconnect will perform comparably to SnAgCu in solder joint quality and better in interconnect yield at the die edge and cryogenic reliability because of the lower reflow temperature. The Phase II project will go on to use actual readout and sensor chips with full interconnect and function characterization.
The defects and damage caused by coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch are problematic not only in the flip chip bonding process for high energy physics but in advanced packaging in all aspects of electronics manufacturing. Electronics manufacturers in consumer electronics, automotive, medical technology, and other sectors are facing commercial market demands to develop products that are thinner, flexible, lighter weight, or have higher-density miniaturization with increased functionality. The self-assembly process of supercooled liquid metal microcapsules proven out in the Phase I and then advanced to commercial readiness in a Phase II will allow these industries to meet this demand with new designs and materials that are otherwise unsuitable for high-heat interconnect processes, while at the same time improving operating efficiency by forming interconnects 3X to 15X faster than current methods and reducing associated operating energy costs by up to 70%."

The STTR program is a vehicle to support the creation of new, for-profit entities that will work closely with a research institution. This subtopic solicits applications for spinning out solutions from research institutions with the goal of advancing solar energy technologies by lowering cost, increasing domestic content in solar hardware, and facilitating its secure integration into the nation’s energy grid.
Addressing the Problem: Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) thin film technology has demonstrated its potential as a low-cost, high-performance alternative to Chinese multi-crystalline silicon technology. The primary goal in this effort is to develop a low-cost, high-volume, and scalable CdTe feedstock manufacturing technology for next-generation industrial CdTe photovoltaics (PVs). The CdTe material feedstock will be tuned or optimized for high-efficiency solar cell production used in today’s industrial photovoltaic manufacturing, and the next-generation PV device manufacturing. The success of this effort will move the United States Department of Energy closer to achieving the goals specified in the SunShot initiative by advancing PV performance and reducing manufacturing costs.
Phase 1 Summary: In Phase I, it is proposed to develop the High-Pressure Bridgman (HPB) technique for low-cost and high-volume processing for synthesizing doped and undoped CdTe feedstock into commercial production at RDT. Effort will focus on the technology transfer from Washington State University to RDT. Photovoltaic films will be fabricated and characterized in this effort by the Center for Next Generation Photovoltaics at Colorado State University. A robust CdTe feedstock manufacturing technology and high quality CdTe materials will be available to the solar industry; a process that can be scaled to a production level the industry has not experienced yet. The success of this effort can disrupt the current thin film solar energy supply chain.
Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: CdTe has the physical properties necessary for PV applications; a low-cost manufacturability, and durability. Laboratory CdTe solar cell efficiency has improved from 17% to 21.5%, now matching silicon-based efficiencies. These efficiencies are still well below the CdTe achievable efficiency. At the same time, industrial solar panels have exceeded 18%. The cost of industrial CdTe PVs is now approaching 40¢/W making it the most likely PV technology to reach DOE SunShot goals. The current state-of-the art for CdTe feedstock production is the cold-Traveler Heater Method (Cold-THM) which has limits to the amount of material that can be synthesized within a single run. The HPB method is scalable and capable of producing materials the solar industry is requesting, such as group-V doped CdTe, a material that is very challenging to produce by the cold-THM. From the increased charge size, reduced waste streams, and reduced labor costs associated with the HPB technique, there is a ~43% cost reduction in feedstock CdTe production that can be passed on directly to the customer. There are two primary benefits from the success of this effort through Phase II and beyond: 1) Cost reduction of undoped feedstock CdTe and next-generation CdTe variants, and 2) Paving the pathway to increased CdTe PV performance through group-V doping."

Many more complications occur in non-surgical settings. This project will use machine learning to combine proven engineering principles with clinical expertise to identify and address specific risks for each procedure, care facility, and patient (accounting for high-impact risk factors ranging from diabetes to social determinants of health). This technology will augment existing standardized, outcome-oriented quality-improvement tools with cost-effective customized, process-oriented tools in a novel way, with an envisioned initial application for the ~5,100 community hospitals in the US.A modest improvement of 1% of complications would annually reduce costs by nearly $1 billion and will save 4,500+ lives.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use a systems-based approach to examine process-level risk in healthcare.

As envisioned, the technology resulting from this project may enable developers to write user-friendly human interfaces for VR software by removing the current constraints posed by the need to master the domain of brainwaves. The project seeks to provide capabilities for deriving the user’s mental and emotional states, thus facilitating objective user feedback. That new capability may impact other domains, including education and therapy. Acquiring capabilities to establish relationships between the mental and emotional states of the users and the VR and real-world environment stimuli could be developed and used to identify patterns that may answer important questions about human behavior and help people with limited mobility.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the use of brainwaves to control VR environments. This project will develop techniques for inferring users’ decisions while navigating a VR environment and for deriving insights into users’ reactions to stimuli in real-world and VR environments. For this Phase I proof-of-concept work, these innovative techniques will be evaluated in jury consulting and game therapy scenarios. The research addresses four technical hurdles:1) inferring users’ decisions in virtual environments from brainwaves with reasonable accuracy, 2) deriving insights into users’ intellectual and emotional states as a result of exposure to stimuli, 3) designing an architecture for useable brainwaves-based applications, and 4) designing security and privacy solutions for this VR system.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) sectors are expected to grow but that will only be economically viable if the UAV and AAM operations are highly automated. The technology developed in this project uses a new trajectory-based approach to aircraft and airspace operations to support that level of automation. The immediate focus of the project is on the emerging AAM aircraft and airspace, but the technology has an even broader potential impact for application to the commercial Air Traffic Control (ATC) system. In the United States, over a period of one year, over 1800 operational errors (breaches of minimum required separation) were officially attributed to airspace controller error. The commercial ATC is largely a manual system and and there is a limit to the number of flights air traffic controllers can manage with incremental improvements of the present system. Expansions in the number of airborne vehicles (of all sorts) requires that air traffic control systems be more automated to maintain their safety record.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to produce a functioning proof-of-concept demonstration of an autonomous aircraft and airspace management and control system for AAM class vehicles. These aviation sectors are expected to see a rapid expansion but the highly manual implementation of airspace control will not be practical or economically viable. The objective of this research is to support a much higher level of automation, enabling the growth of the sectors. Aircraft missions are defined by 4D analytic flightpath models; Aircraft are must precisely follow the flightpaths set by the models. Deterministic and certain algorithms autonomously detect and resolve potential loss of separation events between flightpath models of all aircraft in the airspace. The autopilots allow the aircraft to operate autonomously and the deconfliction ensures safe operation of the airspace.

Healthcare costs continue to increase in the United States (US). This trend, coupled with current and projected manpower shortages in the healthcare sector, is driving the relevant stakeholders to consider innovative solutions to appropriately manage healthcare costs while still providing high-quality healthcare to patients. While other sectors of the economy have greatly benefited from increased use of automation to improve efficiency and cost containment, for a variety of reasons, the healthcare sector is lagging in implementing these innovations in a systemic way. With this opportunity in mind, this Phase I STTR project aims to prove the feasibility of developing a unique, semi-autonomous robotic platform that will be adaptable to many medical procedures. As envisioned, the technology may lead to key advances, including improved patient outcomes and levels of care while increasing procedure/staff efficiencies, and reducing medical costs.The objective of this Phase I effort is to demonstrate a proof of concept for an integrated procedural unit for semi-autonomously performing paracenteses. The prototype system to be completed during this stage is comprised of an ultrasound probe, motorized anesthetic syringe, scalpel, and aspiration needle, and can be integrated into standard, commercially available robotic units. The algorithm will be developed using Bayesian indexingbased on ultrasound images to execute ascites fluid removal in both virtual and mechanical simulations. Based on the preliminary work done by the multidisciplinary team of medical, robotic, and artificial intelligence (AI)) experts, the company plans to create and test a compact robotic device with the required sensory and driving components.

Continuum Educational Technologies’ (Continuum) will work with the University of Kansas (KU) on the
proposed I-RED program entitled Smart Tools to Accelerate Research Translation by Uplifting Participants for
the Central IDeA State Region (STARTUP Central) program to stimulate technological innovation in the IDeA
state regions by addressing the entrepreneurial educational needs of investigators in translating scientific
discoveries from research laboratories into commercial products that improve human health and promote
economic growth. Through the proposed effort, STARTUP Central will help the Central Region address a
persistent gap between its robust biomedical research activities and the development of a comparable pipeline
of academic entrepreneurs commercializing the many innovations resulting from this research.
Continuum’s proposed suite of educational products will provide a comprehensive, uniform, and assessable
mechanism for developing robust cultures of entrepreneurship within individual regional institutions, and will
provide a centralized mechanism for individual institutions to coordinate efforts, share resources, and develop
regional best-practices. These “smart” tools will seek to organize and systemize the abundance of information
and basic educational resources available regarding biomedical translation, employing educational psychology
principles for adult online learning to develop an integrated and effective curriculum from an otherwise
disparate and disconnected collection of resources and programming. Back-end analytics, user-feedback, and
evaluation features will be heavily embedded into the learning management system to provide users,
institutions, and Continuum with a means to continuously assess and improve the usability and effectiveness of
the educational tools and their content, as well as to assess and maximize the impact of the products on
individual users and the broader entrepreneurial culture of each institutional customer.
In Phase 1, Continuum and KU will work collaboratively to assemble the project consortium and make all
preparations to run the Phase 2 Pilot Project program. The team will work together to input content for and
design a wireframe model of the educational products. These wireframe products will then be initially tested,
iteratively redesigned, and initially validated. At the end of Phase 1, the validated wireframe educational
product will be ready for full enhancement and used in the two Pilot Project programs in Phase 2. Assessment
of the enhanced smart educational products to meet user needs in the two Pilot Project programs will be used
to iteratively redesign the educational products. At the end of Phase 2, the smart educational products and the
format of the Pilot Project program will be ready for commercialization.
Outcomes will be assessed based on enhanced entrepreneurship attitudes, confidence, and competency in the
program participants compared to the control. Metrics to evaluate program outcomes include number of
products developed, number of licensing agreements signed, number of students and faculty being trained
through the various aspects of STARTUP Central, number of patents filed, number of SBIR/STTR applications
submitted and awarded by any federal agency, and number of start-up companies launched.PROJECT NARRATIVE - STARTUP CENTRAL
Continuum Educational Technologies will collaborate with the University of Kansas and other Central Region
IDeA State universities to develop an integrated suite of entrepreneurial education products to help university
bioscience researchers commercialize their discoveries and bring critical biomedical innovations to market.
Composed of a comprehensive curriculum and integrated learning management system, along with a
framework for its cohort based implementation in an institutional setting, the product suite will seek to inspire,
educate, train, and support academic entrepreneurs to increase both the number of opportunities for
entrepreneurial commercialization of university research, as well as the likelihood that such efforts will be
successful."

Cancer immunotherapy activates the host immune system to seek and destroy cancer cells. Checkpoint
inhibitors block immunosuppressive signals, thereby ‘releasing the brakes’ of the immune system. Solid tumors,
however, typically do not respond well to checkpoint inhibitors. They are only effective in the 20-30% patients
with an already immunologically ‘hot’ tumor. Thus, novel immunostimulant therapies aim to recruit immune cells
to tumor tissue, turning cold tumors hot and working synergistically with checkpoint inhibitors.
Immunostimulants that induce local immune-cell infiltration may induce an Abscopal effect and may increase
responsiveness in patients that are resistant to checkpoint inhibitors. Unfortunately, immunostimulants often
induce systemic immune-related adverse events (e.g., cytokine release syndrome), even when administered
locally to tumor tissue. Most immunostimulants exhibit molecular properties promoting diffusion and systemic
absorption (e.g., small molecular size, negative charge, high water solubility), This presents a major limitation
as it leads to limited immune activation in the target tumor tissue after administration and immune-related
adverse events. In this project, we will advance KIN-001 – a tumor-retentive formulation of the immunostimulant
CpG designed to persist in tumor tissue thereby mitigating systemic immune-related adverse events and
potentiating immune activity in the tumor microenvironment and draining lymph nodes. KIN-001 is a small
volume nanosuspension for intratumoral injection comprised of commercially available glatiramer acetate (GA)
(Copaxone®, approved for multiple sclerosis) complexed with CpG (immunostimulant). Through preliminary
studies of KIN-001, our group has demonstrated its efficacy in recruiting immune cells to the tumor without
inducing significant systemic cytokines, and we have identified the optimal mass ratio of GA to CpG. This Phase
I STTR study has three Specific Aims: In Specific Aim 1, we will complete an in-use stability study of different
formulations of KIN-001 to demonstrate that KIN-001 is a stable composition and quality is maintained between
preparation and injection into the tumor under anticipated conditions of use. Specific Aim 2 will focus on
identifying the maximum tolerated dose of KIN-001 compared to CpG in a predominant immunotherapy mouse
model. In Specific Aim 3, we will establish proof of mechanism by elucidating KIN-001’s tumor retention and
synergy potential when combined with anti-PD1, a checkpoint inhibitor. The long-term goal of this project is to
commercialize KIN-001 as the first and only tumor-retentive immunostimulant with low toxicity for cancer
patients that have palpable (i.e., injectable) solid tumors and are refractory to checkpoint inhibitors. KIN-001
will improve efficacy of standard treatment (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors) with minimal side effects, leading to
improved outcomes and survival.PROJECT NARRATIVE

Cold spray has the potential to answer both of these issues. Cold Spray Additive Manufacturing (CSAM) technology is capable of depositing layers of metal onto a surface without the need of additional processing or welding. In contrast to fusion based additive manufacturing processes which depend on thermal energy, CSAM is a solid state process and uses kinetic energy to bond materials together.

Methods of reducing and treating knee injuries have changed with the development and improvement of knee braces over time. A significant problem yet to be addressed in the current design of knee braces is the number of people that experience performance limitations and discomfort while braced. Most knee brace frames incorporate standard bilateral, polycentric hinges, which provide a stabilizing force to the flexion and extension of the knee. While this method attempts to mimic the joint’s natural movement, it falls short in allowing the knee to rotate internally and externally. During the last 30° of extension, either the tibia or femur must externally or internally rotate approximately 10°. While this rotation may seem small, it remains essential for the healthy motion of the knee and maximal performance. Rotation must occur to achieve full flexion and extension. If either the tibia or femur is held in a fixed position, this can alter the mechanics of the knee and lead to an increased chance of injury. By eliminating the joint’s ability to rotate, the brace begins to fight against the joint’s proper motion, decreasing the ability of the service member to move with fluidity and increasing the risk of brace migration and injury. Additionally, available market options do not allow for the natural pistoning effect (lengthening and shortening of the frame) the brace undergoes when the leg flexes and extends. Without the allowance for rotation or pistoning, there is a need to continuously adjust the brace’s fit as migration of the frame down the leg occurs frequently.  ARYSE has incorporated a unique technology, referred to as functional stability, into the proposed knee-injury-reduction technology. Current bracing standards cause joint restriction, resulting in a transfer of injury risk to other joints within the kinetic chain.

In vibration testing, Enduralock fasteners survived 10x the aerospace requirement. They remain locked even with loss of preload (clamping force). Fasteners used in critical aerospace applications are often safety-wired together to reduce the chance of loosening with vibration, which is very labor-intensive and therefore costly. Alternatively, castle nuts with cotter pins are utilized to secure fasteners in critical applications, but this can also be very labor intensive. A mechanic can typically safety-wire 10 fasteners per hour at an hourly labor rate of $150. In that same period of time, over 300 of Enduralock’s Silver Lock fasteners could be installed. Castle nuts and cotter pins are frequently used in the landing gear assembly of aircraft. Being a critical application, a narrow range of torque is typically specified by the engineers. A castle nut only has 6 gradations of torque per revolution. If the mechanic attempts to apply the nut with the prescribed torque, and the slots of the nut do not line up with the pre-drilled hole in the bolt to place the pin, he removes the nut and tries another. He will continue this process occasionally for up to one hour for one bolt. Enduralock’s fasteners have 36 gradations of torque per revolution.  It is, therefore, likely that the mechanic will achieve the prescribed torque on the first attempt resulting in a significant reduction of maintenance time. V-Band clamps employ safety wire to lock them, but this is labor-intensive and costly. Enduralock will apply its fastener locking mechanism in the development of a V-Band clamp that mechanically locks and is high vibration resistant, which will reduce maintenance time and cost. Nut plates are used as the female receptacle for bolts attaching aircraft access panels. With current nut plates, there is radial flotation of the nut element, but the nut element will not “tip” to engage an off-axis bolt. This results in a significant amount of maintenance time for panels such as the fuselage fairing and leading and trailing wing edge panels, as mechanics need to line up all bolts in axis with their nut plates, before tightening the first. Bolts are captured to the panel with retaining rings that slide longitudinally on the bolt, but these can bind and break leading to foreign object debris (FOD). The nut element of Enduralock’s nut plate will “tip” to engage an off-axis bolt and then self-align, and it allows for a fixed position bolt retaining ring reducing FOD. It results in a significant reduction of maintenance time. In summary, by developing and testing Enduralock’s fasteners, nut plates, and V-Band clamps as substitution components, flight line maintenance times will improve for the B-1, B-2, and KC-135."

This is through the development of its mechanically locking, high vibration resistant fasteners as component substitutions on the equipment. Ground support equipment such as generators and compressors are subject to high vibration, which can lead to fasteners loosening and the resultant need for maintenance of the equipment. Conventional fasteners with self-locking nuts and bolts, are not reliable when used to assemble components of systems exposed to very high vibration. A small loss in preload, specifically in systems exposed to high vibration, results in a failure of the bolted joint. It is imperative that for systems undergoing high vibration, a permanently locking fastener technology be used for the system assembly. The disadvantage of the use of conventional permanently locking fasteners is that for maintenance they need to be cut out and then replaced. The ideal fastener for use in a high vibration environment would be a mechanically locking fastener that is easy to apply and easy to remove, with the cost benefit of reuse of the fasteners during maintenance operations on the equipment. Fasteners used in critical applications are often safety-wired together to reduce the chance of loosening with vibration, which is very labor-intensive and therefore costly. A mechanic can typically safety-wire 10 fasteners per hour at an hourly labor rate of $150. In that same period of time, over 300 of Enduralock’s Silver Lock fasteners could be installed. Enduralock’s Tidal Lock Fastener and its Locking Header Bolt technologies allow for permanence in the assembled joint due to their mechanical lock. They also provide for easy reversibility and reusability with a standard hex socket which disengages the mechanical lock. In vibration testing, Enduralock fasteners survived 10x the aerospace requirement without failure. Reusability has been demonstrated to 250x. If bolt elongation occurs over time, the fastener can be easily retensioned with a standard socket. They remain locked even with loss of preload (clamping force), so they are unaffected by thermal changes in the equipment or the environment causing expansion or contraction of the bolts with resultant loss of preload. In summary, by developing and testing Enduralock’s fasteners as substitution components for B-1, B-2, and KC-135 ground support equipment, the reliability of the equipment will be improved, and less maintenance of the equipment will be required. This will result in improved maintenance times for the B-1, B-2, and KC-135 aircraft."

Ting Therapeutics LLC is a pharmaceutical company developing drugs to prevent and treat hearing loss.
Cisplatin is one of the most widely used drugs to treat cancers. However cisplatin anticancer therapy causes
high frequency hearing loss in 40-60% of the patients. To date, no drugs have been approved by the Food and
Drug Administration for protection from cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Most candidate compounds currently in
pre-clinical and clinical trials are related to antioxidants, vitamins, and glutathione metabolism, and thus many of
these compounds, such as sodium thiosulfate, can interfere with cisplatin’s ability to kill the tumor cells. We
recently conducted unbiased high-throughput screens of bioactive compounds in a cochlear ear cell line and
identified cyclin dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) inhibitors as important therapeutic compounds for cisplatin-induced
cell death and hearing loss. Among those compounds, TT001 was the most potent CDK2 inhibitor tested. Results
from our SBIR Phase I, demonstrated that oral TT001 ameliorated cisplatin-induced hearing loss with no general
toxicity. Moreover, TT001 did not interfere with cisplatin anti-cancer activity in vitro. In this SBIR Phase II, we will
perform Investigational New Drug-enabling experiments to test TT001’s effect on cisplatin’s tumor killing efficacy
in vivo and to conduct efficacy studies to define an optimal dosing regimen and therapeutic index. The long-term
goal is for TT001 to become a standard otoprotective drug of cisplatin-based therapies. For this purpose, we will
demonstrate TT001’s efficacy in a mouse model of cisplatin ototoxicity that mimics the administration protocol in
cancer patients (Aim1). We will determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles in blood and
perilymph, as well as efficacy, in a guinea pig model for cisplatin-induced hearing loss (Aim 2). This Aim will be
performed under contract with and independent and reputable Contract Research Organization, Turner Scientific
LLC. Finally, we will verify that TT001 does not interfere with cisplatin’s anti-cancer activity in vivo in mouse
model xenografts (Aim 3). By successfully completing these studies, Ting Therapeutics will obtain critical data
necessary for the initiation of Investigational New Drug-enabling Good Laboratory Practice complaint studies
and clinical trials. Ting Therapeutics LLC has the exclusive international rights for the use of CDK2 inhibitors in
the treatment of hearing loss. The company has filed for international patents in Japan, Europe, China and Hong
Kong. The patent in Europe and China has been awarded; similar patent applications are pending in US, Japan
(No 2020-156803), and Hong Kong. Ting Therapeutics is negotiating with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital
for the US Method of Use patent rights on CDK2 inhibitors for hearing loss (US Patent Application No.
62/181,755; PCT/US16/38384; WO 2016/205806). The completion of this proposal will allow Ting Therapeutics
to initiate conversations with pharmaceutical companies for the manufacturing and licensing of TT001."

Student engagement in hands-on model building, experimental design, and simulation-based exploration has been shown
to propel student learning of biological concepts towards increasing complexity. The long-term goal in developing Model
It! is to integrate computational models and simulations throughout all K-12 formal and informal science education. The
foundation of this integration is based on the need to i) increase student science literacy by leveraging inquiry-based and
constructivist learning environments, ii) broaden interest in STEM careers by engaging youth in STEM technology that is
accessible, attainable, and based on biological processes impacting our communities - diabetes, cancers, infectious
diseases, iii) and leverage state-of-the-art technology that grows with students as they increase their knowledge about
biological processes, computational modeling and simulations, and critical problem solving of life and health science
issues. The Project Team has expertise in scaling computational modeling and simulations software in the education space
as well as working with community learning programs to train program leaders and facilitators on how to engage diverse
youth in informal learning environments, and how to leverage technologies in after-school programming.
For Phase I, the Project Team proposes to develop the Model It! prototype, consisting of two introductory courses, each
with 5 levels for students to first develop skills in hands-on model building, then develop skills in running computational
simulations. The Project Team will train after-school program facilitators from Beyond School Bells, our partner and
Nebraska’s statewide Expanded Learning Opportunity Innovation Network. The facilitators will engage 60 students in
after-school STEM programs two to three times a week. The facilitators will play a critical role in the design, testing, and
iterating, and deployment of Model It! in order to make it age-appropriate for K-12 youth. Facilitators will provide
qualitative feedback throughout the process, as well as quantitative feedback via the System Usability Scale (Brooke,
1996) Technology Acceptance Model (David, 1989), Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen, 1991), and Diffusion of
Innovation Theory (Rogers, 2003) survey instruments designed to gauge technology ease-of-use. Data collected from both
the facilitators as well as anonymized student data collected via Model It! during student interactions with the technology
will be utilized to further enhance the technology’s usability and scalability.
For Phase II, The Project Team will scale the courses beyond introductory skills into progressively more complex
computational modeling, simulation, and data analysis modules. The team will also focus on additional technology
accessibility, including further gamifying the learning progression, supporting touch-screens, and expanding the content to
include additional angles of biomedical and health-related topics (e.g., seasonal influenza infection, keto dieting versus
low-fat dieting, how the immune system functions, etc.)."

in patients with burns, severe wounds, pneumonia, and critically ill patients who require intubation or
catheterization. Clearing Pa is difficult due to antibiotic resistance. There are ~32,600 cases of multi-drug
resistant (MDR) Pa in hospitalized patients annually with 2700 deaths and $757 million in patient care costs.
Additionally, Pa is the major cause of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with rt70% of this
population being chronically colonized by their teens. Military personnel are gravely impacted by the occurrence
of MDR Pa in combat-related injuries. Equally important is the fact that the biggest risk factor for negative
outcomes associated with infection by MDR Pa is advanced age. After age 60, there is a significant increase in
morbidity and mortality resulting from MDR Pa infection. Thus, a broadly protective Pa vaccine has large market
potential with up to three vaccinations providing complete protection to all humans. Hundreds of millions of
vaccine doses would be given annually, approaching ~$5B in sales. While there are Pa vaccines in development,
none have been licensed. The goal of our technology is a prophylactic vaccine that prevents initial

mechanism for microwave ablation (MWA) procedures used for the thermal treatment of localized
cancer. Although MWA provides a minimally invasive, low cost, outpatient therapy that has
comparable outcomes to the gold standard surgical resection for small tumors, local recurrence
rates remain considerably higher for large tumors (rt 3 cm diameter). Inadequate thermal dose
delivery to the targeted tumor and failure to establish an adequate treatment margin is believed
to be a primary cause of thermal ablation’s higher recurrence rates. While contrast-enhanced
imaging with X-ray CT provides a means for verifying the ablation volume post-procedure, there
are no techniques for monitoring the ablation zone and providing actionable information during
the procedure. Incomplete ablation could result in disease recurrence and necessitate
reperformance of the procedure, burdening patients and hospitals where the CT-suite is a
capacity constrained resource. Alternatively, excessive thermal dose could inadvertently injure
nearby healthy tissues and require additional medical intervention. Leveraging unique capabilities
of the patented directional MWA (DMWA) applicator our team previously developed, we identified
a new method which uses our applicators to both deliver treatment and act as sensors to track
the status and estimate the completion of MWA procedures in real time. This innovation provides
clinicians critical intra-procedural feedback and give confidence that they achieved the result they
wanted and did not over- or under-treat while also preserving the integrity of the target organ and
reducing the chance of collateral injury to other sensitive tissues. This innovation does not require
significant changes to current clinical workflow or preclude continued use of post-ablation
confirmation imaging. The overall objective of this R43 SBIR Phase I application is to show
technical proof of concept for our proposed feedback method. The approach for our first specific
aim includes development of a predictive coupled electromagnetic-heat transfer physics model of
our feedback system using finite element method software tools. We will then construct an
experimental apparatus to monitor and record the electromagnetic parameters utilized in our
feedback system and conduct ex vivo benchtop experimentation to show proof-of-concept and
refine our computer model. Our second specific aim includes an in vivo study in collaboration with
our veterinary school to evaluate our feedback system in a clinical setting using post-procedure
CT imaging and histopathology. Our long-term goal is to improve safety and effectiveness of MWA
to expand patient access to minimally invasive, affordable, outpatient treatment of cancer."

Outcomes in pediatric liver transplantation (pLT) are not limited by the donated organ supply. Kids are dying
waiting for organs even when these deaths are completely preventable through proper organ selection. Instead of
dying, children can live a full and active lifetime with a properly selected liver graft for transplant. Critical to
achieving zero waitlist mortality and long-term transplant benefit is the capacity to intervene in a timely manner
with a suitable organ and graft type. Decisions to proceed with pLT are complicated, ultimately based on the
alignment of transplant team experience, clinical assessment, and organ availability. In an era of organ shortages,
the use of technical variant (TV) grafts, including split liver transplantation and living donor liver transplant, has
the potential to expand graft choice and enable timelier surgical intervention. Most transplant programs that have
prior experience with TV grafts have low patient mortality and excellent transplant outcomes. However, some
transplant programs that have limited prior experience with TV grafts have reported many poor outcomes for
patients receiving TV transplants. Despite improvements in overall outcomes, national registry data have
confirmed significant variation among transplant centers in waitlist mortality, TV graft use, and post-transplant
outcomes. Integrally linked to this variation is the intricacy of transplant decision making. Collectively, donor
and graft acceptance, prioritization of candidates, and allocation policies depict a complex scenario. More than
100 variables can be considered in a single donor-recipient ‘‘best matching’’ decision, with a risk of subjectivity
and mismatch because of human limitations that should not be underestimated. Recognizing these limitations,
artificial intelligence classifiers, including machine learning and deep learning, have been recognized for their
potential to support or confirm decision making within the field of transplantation. Still, overall data-driven
support for optimal graft selection and dissemination of graft decision support is lacking. Opportunities for, and
the impact of, discovery are high. This project will result in a composite decision support software tool that uses
machine learning to predict and model the best survival for the patient using pre-transplant mortality, post-
transplant outcomes, and prior center experience. The decision support tool can be established to supplement
current graft selection practices in pLT. We anticipate that modeling based on composite measures will
demonstrate equivalent outcomes in recipients of TV grafts. We will develop an algorithm for optimal pediatric
graft-type selection that will be commercialized for use through the Starzl Network for Excellence in Pediatric
Transplantation and after further multi-center validation it will be available for all pediatric transplant programs.
We will accomplish our objective through the following three aims. One, determine the optimal feature space for
predictive variables for patient and pLT graft survival. Two, develop survival prediction models, “PSELECT,” for

therapy. In particular, this is true for key nutrients such as Vitamin A, D, B9 and B12. Unfortunately, the current
“one size fits all” approaches for determining whether an individual has adequate levels of these and other
micronutrients relies on older studies that use serum assays that only capture recent intake that do not capture
the health care challenges incurred by our now aging, more diverse populationWe believe that integrated genetic-epigenetic assessments of saliva DNA can better capture cellular
micronutrient status and serve as a cornerstone of future Precision NutriEpigenomic therapies. Our method,
which does not require drawing blood, will be robust against day-to-day dietary intake fluctuations and can be
conducted using remote, telemedicine type approaches. This more functionally oriented method could find
widespread use in a variety of both medical and non-medical nutraceutical settings in optimizing athletic
performance, facilitating healthy aging and monitoring nutritional supplemental of both chronic (e.g., digestive
disease) and acute (e.g., chemotherapy) patients. For example, the method is generalized for the assessments
targeting the use of common supplements such as Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+).We hypothesize that integrated genetic-epigenetic signatures of saliva DNA will robustly predict serum B9
and B12 levels. To test that hypothesis, we will use data from a cohort of 450 African Americans for whom we
already have serum, genome wide genetic, and genome wide epigenetic data from whole blood DNA. We will
use machine learning to first mine the most predictive biosignature for serum B9 and B12 levels. Next, using our
patent-pending, proprietary techniques, we will translate that whole blood (WB) DNA based signature into a
saliva-based signature. Then, we will transform the test into an easy to perform set of methylation sensitive
digital PCR assays.If successful, the project will have high impact because it could lead to painless, at-home nutraceutical
testing. It is significant because certain nutrients are thought to be protective against cancer or premature
aging. Our plan is highly feasible because the large body of prior work, abundant biomaterials, and our
expertise in both epigenetics and machine learning. It is innovative because saliva diagnostics have not yet
been introduced to the nutraceutical market. The BD team is well qualified. The project will led by Dr. Rob
Philibert, an expert in epigenetic diagnostics. He will be assisted by a team of co-investigators that includes
experts in nutrition (Dr. Ruth Grossman) and biostatistics (Dr. Jeff Long). If successful, this R43 will serve as

Ting Therapeutics LLC is a pharmaceutical company developing drugs to prevent and treat hearing loss.
Cisplatin is one of the most widely used drugs to treat cancers. However, cisplatin therapy causes hearing loss
in 40-60% of the patients. To date, no drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
protection from cisplatin-induced hearing loss (CIHL). Most candidate compounds currently in pre-clinical and
clinical trials are related to antioxidants, vitamins, and glutathione metabolism, many of which, such as sodium
thiosulfate, interfere with cisplatin’s ability to kill the tumor cells. We have performed unbiased in silico virtual
screens for otoprotectants against CIHL and identified 20 FDA-approved drugs including TT002, known as
niclosamide, an anthelmintic (gut worm) drug used in humans world-wide for nearly four decades. In vitro: TT002
showed a comparable level of protection against cisplatin damage in a cochlear cell line to kenpaullone, with an
IC50 of 0.17 μM, substantially (rt10X) lower and better than four other benchmark otoprotectants. Moreover,
TT002 did not interfere with cisplatin anti-cancer activity in vitro. In vivo: TT002 attenuates hearing loss in adult
mice treated with cisplatin (30 mg/kg once) when delivered intraperitoneally (IP) at 10 mg/kg/day for 4
consecutive days. Interestingly, TT002 also protects against NIHL (100 dB SPL 8-16 kHz for 2 hrs) in adult FVB
mice when delivered IP at 10 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days. In this SBIR Phase II, we will perform
Investigational New Drug-enabling experiments to test TT002’s effect on cisplatin’s tumor killing efficacy in vivo
and to conduct efficacy studies to define an optimal dosing regimen and therapeutic index. The long-term goal
is for TT002 to become a standard otoprotective drug of cisplatin-based therapies. For this purpose, we will
demonstrate TT002’s efficacy in a mouse model of cisplatin ototoxicity that mimics the administration protocol in
cancer patients (Aim 1). We will determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles in blood and
perilymph, as well as efficacy, in a guinea pig model for cisplatin-induced hearing loss (Aim 2). This Aim will be
performed under contract with an independent and reputable Contract Research Organization, Turner Scientific
LLC. Finally, we will test drug-drug interactions in vitro and we will verify, in vivo, that TT002 does not interfere
with cisplatin’s anti-cancer activity in mouse model xenografts (Aim 3). By successfully completing these studies,
Ting Therapeutics will obtain critical data necessary for the initiation of Investigational New Drug enabling
complaint preclinical studies and subsequent clinical trials. Ting Therapeutics has filed a Patent Cooperation
Treaty (PCT) for both the US and international rights. The completion of this proposal will allow Ting Therapeutics
to initiate conversations with pharmaceutical companies and venture investments for the commercialization of
TT002."

proposal will determine if these blast-induced memory/cognitive deficits can be prevented using our orally-
administered multifunctional redox modulator, HK-2, to suppress oxidative stress, metal dyshomeostasis, and
Aβ plaque formation. Dual-acting HK-2: (a) sequesters and redistributes free transition metals preventing the
generation of highly toxic hydroxyl radicals and (b) quenches reactive oxygen and nitrogen radicals (ROS/RNS).
HK-2 has already been shown to protect against noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), prevent Aβ plaque formation
in Alzheimer's transgenic mice and facilitates the degradation of neurotoxic Aβ:Zn plaque complexes associated
with dementia. Rats will be exposed to acoustic blast overpressures (ABO) with and without ear protection in
order to create animal models of TBI or TBI+NIHL. The TBI and TBI+NIHL groups will be treated with HK-2 or
placebo to determine if HK-2 is effective in preventing (1) hippocampal-dependent spatial memory deficits, (2)
the formation of hippocampal Aβ:Zn plaques and (3) the decline in hippocampus neurogenesis, (4) hearing loss
and hair cell loss. Successful demonstration of the efficacy of oral HK-2 in preventing memory deficits,
hippocampal Aβ:Zn plaques and maintaining hippocampal neurogenesis would represent a major scientific
advance with significant clinical implications that would provide the necessary data to submit an SBIR Phase 2
application to fund preclinical and toxicological studies required for obtaining an FDA investigational new drug
(IND) application for subsequent clinical studies."

Commercially available, real-time molecular monitoring technologies are designed to selectively
measure only one molecule at a time at a given recording site. This is a problem because chemical
signals in the brain do not work in isolation; rather, neurotransmission involves many chemical
species simultaneously working to modulate neural circuits. Quantitative analysis of these
neurochemical signals is a critical first step when developing therapeutic strategies to treat
neurological/psychological disorders, but little is known about how specific neurochemicals
fluctuate relative to one another. The Sombers Lab has established the feasibility of using fast-
scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) and carbon-fiber microelectrodes for the real-time detection of
dopamine fluctuations while simultaneously detecting non-electroactive species, such as glucose
and lactate, at the same recording site. The microbiosensors have higher spatial and temporal
resolution than currently available technologies, minimal analyte consumption, and they can be
easily integrated into existing protocols. During Phase I, a 7-um probe was developed and
commercialized that can simultaneously measure dopamine and glucose in real time, at
single micron-scale recording sites in vivo. A software suite and FSCV tutorials were
developed. In Phase II, we will develop and commercialize 7-um dopamine/lactate,
dopamine/glutamate, and serotonin/glucose sensors. We will develop additional tutorials to
simplify access to this important technology, and we will continue to develop software and
electronics. Overall, this project is innovative, because it departs from the status quo by utilizing
the redox activity inherent to enzymatically generated H2O2 to identify targeted non-electroactive
species, even in the presence of electroactive molecules that are typically excluded as
interferents. It is significant, because it combines two state-of-the-art and well-characterized
technologies for neurochemical monitoring in a clever, straightforward, and unprecedented
manner. Ultimately, this project will provide the community with a sensor suite that can be used
to study the interplay of a range of critical analytes in complex physiological processes ranging
from basic endocrine function to motivation. It promises to have a transformative effect on
neuroscience by allowing researchers interested in diverse aspects of brain function to better
understand how these specific neurochemicals co-fluctuate in discrete brain locations."

This hybrid AM system solution will primarily combine additive & subtractive functions, that will allow for parallel manufacturing of parts for DON in the shipboard environment and increase DON’s warfighter readiness, distributed manufacturing capabilities, and self-sufficiency. PIMS will include a two (2)-robot system to carry out additive, deformation, non-destructive evaluation (NDE), build form scanning and dimensional measurement, and subtractive processes.

A wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) process will be used for the additive function of PIMS because of the process’ high deposition rate, acceptable feature resolution (low to medium), and ability to rapidly print small and large parts, in a cost-effective manner. A sensor package will be developed and attached to the PIMS cell to monitor the build process in-situ, notify the DON user when the process is outside the normal operating window, and perform corrective actions when needed. Subtractive manufacturing will be performed on the WAAM builds in the PIMS through the use of interchangeable machining tools in the tool holders.

Many coal-fired power plants are reaching the end of their life and are unlikely to be replaced by new coal fired plants due to emissions. Electrical power demand is expected to increase steadily through year 2050 due to population growth and increased electric vehicle popularity. Natural gas power plants can cover some of this shortfall, but long-term natural gas prices are unknown. The US Department of Energy and other parties are looking to small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) for a solution. They are designed to be inherently safer and less expensive to build and operate than older nuclear power. They can also do “double duty” by providing process heat for desalination of seawater, manufacture of hydrogen gas, biofuel production, and many others. Cold spray, a solid-state materials deposition technology, will be used to apply robust corrosion-protective coatings on SMR components. This will let many components be made of carbon steel, a less expensive and easier to use material than stainless steels and other high-performance alloys. Cold Spray can apply many different metals onto carbon steel, such as pure nickel, pure titanium, or Inconel 625, to provide excellent corrosion protection that tolerates high temperatures. In Phase I, these materials were successfully deposited onto A516 carbon steel. In Phase II the corrosion behaviors of those coatings have been tested, high-temperature “non-stick” nozzles have been developed to allow deposition of these materials at high process gas temperatures and long durations without clogging or wearing out. A modular and flexible system to apply these coatings on an industrial scale has also been developed and built that can operate multiple powder feeders in parallel or in sequence as desired. This allows lengthy sprays by seamlessly switching from an almost empty feeder to a full one, and refilling the almost empty one. Feeding simultaneously can facilitate very high deposition rates. In Phase IIB the developments in Phase II will be thoroughly tested and vetted for commercial deployment in industrial settings. The system and nozzles will be operated at lengthy intervals to identify and correct any issues that prevent successful industrial deployment. The nonstick nozzles will also be redesigned for faster and more economical materials deposition. A thoroughly vetted cold spray system for industrial scales will help make and maintain SMRs economically, which will provide reasonably-priced carbon-free electrical power. The system will be suitable for many other industries as well, including traditional nuclear power, wind power, biofuels, and many others. Five commercial actors have submitted letters of support for these developments, and will provide initial sales upon completion."

Purification of SWCNT by aqueous two-phase (ATP) separation is a process developed at NIST that is efficient and effective. Yet, until recently, its use has been limited to manual, bench-scale deployment. To greatly expand potential SWCNT use and practicality, Zymosense—as part of a successful Phase I SBIR proof-of-concept NIST project—has demonstrated a high-throughput, semi-automated method to screen/optimize ATP separations. It is the intent of the follow-on Phase II project proposed here to achieve the following: 1) screen and optimize this process to maximize separation quality and efficiency; 2)
improve process yield by developing/validating methods to mitigate losses due to material aggregation; and 3) prototype purified SWCNT for use and evaluation by beta-testers. Phase II success will allow optimized protocols to then be licensed to SWCNT manufacturers for distribution to end-users. Purified SWCNT will also be used at Zymosense to manufacture enzyme-activity probes with improved stability (>3x) and signal-to-noise ratios (>50x)."

There is currently a technological gap in high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) that has stunted the efficacy
of single-fraction HDR-BT monotherapy for prostate cancer patients and is preventing a shift away from invasive
interstitial brachytherapy to an intracavitary-only approach for cervical cancer patients. The gap is due to the
radiation dose conformity limitations of HDR-BT, and, until a solution is developed, prostate cancer HDR-BT will
continue to have dose conformity limitations due to geometric constraints, requiring multiple needle implants
and/or a hospital stay, and cervical cancer treatments will continue to be invasive, challenging, and time-con-
suming, with limited patient access. The long-term goal is to transfer a technology, called ReNeu, for generating
169Yb sources that can dramatically improve radiation dose conformity, into clinical usage using a business model
based on the substantial cost savings achieved through re-activation in a nuclear reactor. The overall objective
of this project is to demonstrate the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of ReNeu, which is
expected to enable the rotating shield brachytherapy (RSBT) approach to improving dose conformity. 169Yb is
an ideal isotope for RSBT since its specific activity is high enough to match the dose rate of conventional 192Ir in
a similar source volume, and the emitted gamma ray energy is low enough for partial shielding. The proposed
approach for making 169Yb commercially feasible is to simply increase source volume from 1 mm3 to 3 mm3,
while maintaining the conventional source diameter. The source could be (re)activated up to 11 times, and,
based on preliminary work, this process could reduce the overall cost per clinic-year of 169Yb sources by 75%.
The rationale for this work is that ReNeu will provide the framework that will make RSBT commercially viable,
enabling brachytherapy improvements that could benefit tens of thousands of patients per year. A demonstration
of feasibility for the ReNeu approach will be addressed by carrying out two specific aims: (1) Develop a mechan-
ical prototype ReNeu source/wire that enables clinical usage and (2) Develop the (re)activation model for ReNeu
to validate its clinical and commercial potential. Under aim 1, a 169Yb source will be constructed with a 3 mm3
volume that, along with its controlling guidewire, will be capable of re-activation. The expectation is that the
source/wire will successfully pass the tests needed for FDA clearance. Under aim 2, the 169Yb (re)activation
model based on preliminary data will be experimentally calibrated, which will apply for up to 11 (re)activations.
The expectation is that each (re)activation will take 9 days on average, with an average clinical source lifetime
after each (re)activation of 41 days. This contribution is expected to be significant because it removes a major
impediment to improving brachytherapy that could benefit prostate and cervical cancer patients. This work is
innovative because the ReNeu sourceandapos;s increased volume of 3 mm3 in combination with low-curvature RSBT
applicators represents a substantive departure from the status quo by uniquely providing the capability to cost-
effectively deliver single-fraction prostate cancer treatments and non-invasively treat cervical cancer.PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed research is relevant to public health because it represents a commercially feasible approach to
producing a radiation source that can reduce the invasiveness of brachytherapy and therefore reduce the risk
of complications to patients by enabling single-treatment outpatient procedures for prostate cancer patients
and needle-free tumor-conformal intracavitary brachytherapy for cervical cancer patients. Access to high-
efficacy brachytherapy with low toxicity could be improved since single-treatment prostate brachytherapy would
be more attractive to patients and providers than conventional multi-treatment approaches, and non-invasive
intracavitary cervical cancer brachytherapy is easier to perform and has a more widely available skillset than
intracavitary/interstitial brachytherapy. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIHandapos;s mission to help
cervical cancer and prostate cancer patients live longer, healthier lives."

These are comparable to those achievable with NV-diamond chip-scale atomic magnetometers, but without the requirement for microwave fields or optical elements. These small-scale magnetometers would avoid the need to self-calibrate, compared to fluxgate magnetometers, and avoid challenges related to diffusion of gas through a glass cell and radiation damage of fiberoptics.

Although vaccines are commercially available none arecompetent to protect the animal's nervous system from BoHV-1 invasion and the subsequent establishment oflife-long latent infections. In addition to being the source of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) BoHV-1 is acausative agent of ""shipping fever"" which results from stress placed on cattle during shipping that reactivateslatent infection. In fact current modified-live virus (MLV) vaccines retain neuroinvasive and latency propertiesand can become a complicating factor contributing to stress induced reactivations. The failure of existingproducts to offer adequate protection to cattle (from weaning to feed yards) has highlighted the need for avaccine that affords a combination of strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses while lacking theability to establish life-long latent infections in the nervous system. We recently demonstrated that MLVvaccines that replicate in non-neural tissue but are ablated for transmission into the nervous system elicitprotective immune responses without evoking neurologic complications or establishing life-long infections. Thisvaccine design referred to as ""R2"" is based on the removal of a critical neuroinvasive effector region of thepUL37 tegument protein. The safety of R2 vaccines is based on their inability to invade the nervous systemand establish life-long latent infections as opposed to broader replicative attenuation strategies thattraditionally try to balance vaccine safety with efficacy. Unlike traditional BoHV-1 MLV designs R2 vaccines arecleared from the body by the induced immune response. By avoiding attenuation of BoHV-1 replication in themucosa R2 non-invasive vaccines break the safety-efficacy dilemma by producing the strongest possibleimmune response while maintaining an unprecedented degree of safety. In this application we will apply theR2 design to the development of a next-generation BoHV-1 vaccine. This will entail producing an infectiousclone of a native isolate of BoHV-1 and using this clone to make the R2 non-neuroinvasive vaccine. Theresulting recombinant strain will be tested for loss of neuroinvasive potential and vaccine efficacy in calves.This work will provide critical data for a Phase II application and to bring this much needed product to market.Aim 1: Establish a self-excising BAC infectious clone from a BoHV-1 isolate.This new clone be used to produce a vaccine free of intellectual property constraints.Aim 2: Introduce R2 mutations into the BAC and delete the US9 gene to make a marker vaccine derivative.Our established recombination methods will be used to modify the BoHV-1 BAC clone first tomutate the UL37 gene in the R2 effector coding region and second to delete the US9 gene.Propagation of the recovered viruses will be assessed in cell culture.Aim 3: Validate the safety and efficacy of the BoHV-1 live-attenuated vaccine in calves.A Go/No-Go decision to advance the BoHV-1 vaccine will be based on confirmation that the R2mutations ablate the neuroinvasive property of the virus and its virulence while also providingunprecedented protection against native BoHV-1 challenge."

with a 5-yr survival of lt40% due to resistant metastases. Neuroblastoma tumors almost universally express the
somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) and high expression has been shown clinically using peptides targeting SSTR2
(PMID10706954). FDA approved SSTR2-targeted beta(β-)-emitting 177Lu-labeled Lutathera™ has been shown to
be safe and feasible (PMID21680680), but tumor response to SSTR2-targeted β--therapy has been poor. On the
other hand, Viewpoint’s next-generation SSTR2-targeted [212Pb]VMT-α-NET alpha(α)-particle therapy (α-PRRT)
produced complete responses (CRs) in 70% of mice bearing SSTR2+ tumors. Data show that the significantly
improved PK properties of VMT-α-NET compared to competing SSTR2 targeted radiopharmaceuticals leads to
significantly improved tumor to normal accumulation and lower risk of toxicities (particularly in dose limiting kidneys). In
the revised application, the team introduces an innovative immune-competent genetically engineered metastatic
mouse model (GEMM) of neuroblastoma (new Co-Investigator Wang PhD at Nationwide Children’s Hospital) that
genetically mimics neuroblastoma in humans and develops spontaneously in mice. Thus, we will identify effective
regimens and assess potential toxicities (e.g., kidney) and inflammatory markers in preparation for FDA submissions.
The revised project is significant because predicate data demonstrate that Viewpoint’s [212Pb]VMT-α-NET α-PRRT has the potential to provide for complete/durable tumor responses (and be well tolerated) for neuroblastoma
patients. The project is further significant because the GEMM rodent model and CMC plan included is aligned
with FDA guidance for micro-dosed radiopharmaceutical therapeutics and our communications with the FDA for
Fast Track designation. Therefore, there is a critical need to advance Viewpoint’s α-PRRT to clinical trials for
neuroblastoma patients for whom other therapies (including SSTR2 β-particle therapy) fall short.
PREDICATE MILESTONES: $13M Series A; 70% CRs in mice; 203Pb/212Pb secured; Communications with FDA
to secure two INDs and complete a pre-IND meeting with support from the FDA for α-particle therapy for adult
trials. FDA communications are ongoing. We will achieve our objectives by completing these Specific Aims.
AIM 1. Determine the dosing regimens of [203Pb]VMT-α-NET image-guided [212Pb]VMT-α-NET therapy that
maximize complete responses and minimize toxicity in mouse models of metastatic neuroblastoma.
AIM 2. Optimize [212Pb]VMT-α-NET production and complete technology transfer for CMC and IND
submission to the US FDA to initiate a Phase 1 imaging-guided therapy trial in neuroblastoma patients.
IMPACT: With completion of these Aims, we expect to have developed a detailed understanding of the
therapeutic regimens that maximize tumor responses (minimizing toxicity) in metastatic models of neuroblastoma
in mice that align with FDA guidance for a Fast Track application. We further expect to complete formulation and
CMC documentation for the submission of an IND for Phase 1 trials of Viewpoint’s TAT for neuroblastoma."

Metastatic melanoma is a lethal disease because low response rates (near 50%), acquired resistance,
and severe adverse side effects limit long-term quality of life for these patients (5-yr. survival lt30%).
Radiopharmaceutical therapies are emerging as an exciting alternative in oncology and systemic receptor-
targeted alpha-particle therapy (a-RT) is emerging as particularly transformative due to recent reports of
complete responses in early trials. Viewpoint is introducing an MC1R-targeted peptide-based a-RT
([212Pb]VMT01) for Stage III/IV metastatic melanoma and has received IND approval (#152145) to begin
[203Pb]VMT01 imaging trials (Mayo Clinic) to prepare for [212Pb]VMT01 monotherapy trials. However, our now
published predicate RandD (PMID 34359580) revealed a combination of [212Pb]VMT01 a-RT and immunotherapy
(ICI) that achieved a 43% complete response rate in an immune-competent mouse melanoma model and a
tumor-specific immune response to [212Pb]VMT01. This is significant because this model is unresponsive to ICI
alone, which suggests that combining ICIs with a-RT could improve outcomes for thousands of melanoma
patients who are unresponsive to current standard of care treatment with single or dual agent ICI blockade. Thus,
there is a rigorous scientific basis to develop combined ICI therapy and [212Pb]VMT01 for metastatic melanoma.

checkpoint inhibitors that maximize complete responses with minimal toxicities in immune-competent

IMPACT AND SIGNIFICANCE: By completing this project, we expect to have identified dosing regimens for
systemic [212Pb]VMT01 α-RT with immune checkpoint inhibitors that maximize complete responses, while
minimizing toxicities in 4 immune-competent mouse models. We further expect to have developed understanding
of the systemic anti-tumor immune response for primary and metastatic tumors that captures known intertumoral
heterogeneity of metastatic melanoma. We anticipate that this will lead to clinical trials and a new approach to
metastatic melanoma patient care that results in more complete responses and better quality of life."

The objective of this Phase I SBIR is to develop a spinal fusion implant with embedded biomechanically
powered sensor. Evoke Medical’s core technology is to create human-powered implantable devices that utilize
piezoelectric materials to generate load-induced power. That power can then be used for various purposes:
electrical stimulation of bone growth and/or load-sensing to track fusion progression. Through our current Phase
II project, a fully integrated piezoelectric transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) implant was developed
with embedded power generator and miniaturized circuitry for signal conditioning. In this TLIF implant, lower
impedance piezoelectric materials were used to generate power for mechanically synced direct current (DC)
electrical stimulation delivered to an electrode on the implant surface for the purposes of enhancing bone growth.
No batteries are used in any Evoke Medical implant as all energy is biomechanically induced by human motion.
Our preliminary work has also shown that a piezoelectric interbody implant can act as a sensor and distinguish
between different applied physiological loads that correlate to fusion progression.
In other industries, piezoelectric materials are often used as load sensors. In situ, mechanical loads applied to
the piezoelectric device generate proportional electrical voltages that can be translated back to quantify the
applied load on the device. Evoke Medical will use this inherent ability of piezoelectric materials to characterize
the change in load environment within the disc space, and subsequently provide objective data to the clinician
and patient to inform post-operative outcomes and treatment decisions. In spinal fusion, the load on the implant
is highest when the device is first implanted and there is no bony fusion mass around and throughout the implant.
As fusion progresses, the load on the implant is reduced according to the fusion grade achieved due to the
increased surface area and stiffness of the growing bone structure. In this proposal, we will prove that a
custom piezogenerator embedded in a spinal fusion implant with the associated circuit hardware and
data acquisition software can collect, store, and wirelessly transmit changes in load within the interbody
space. These changes can then be related back to fusion progression and other post-operative outcomes.
Evoke Medical has already developed cost-effective manufacturing methods and demonstration of safety and
efficacy of the stimulating aspect of the piezoelectric TLIF that is moving forward in the commercialization
process through a DeNovo regulatory strategy. In these verification tests, we have also proven that we can
successfully harvest patient motion and convert that to usable power under physiological loading conditions. By
developing the load sensing aspect of the TLIF implant now, Evoke Medical will be able to jumpstart our
capabilities to provide patients with biofeedback on how their implant is helping them. It will give surgeons the
ability to quantify healing progress without the multitude of expensive CT scans or potentially biased patient
reported outcome measures. This will allow the physician to make informed postoperative treatment decisions
that could greatly improve the chances of fusion success. Commercialization of this remote load sensing data
tool for spinal fusion patient care is disruptive, will help to reduce healthcare costs, and simultaneously enhance
patient care, particularly in rural or remote areas or in times of limited access to healthcare providers (e.g. during
COVID-19).
In this Phase 1 project, we will first establish that utilizing a textured piezogenerator embedded in a TLIF implant
will power the necessary components in a prototype load sensing circuit. The functionality of integrating the
developed sensor circuit with a data acquisition framework will be verified through a large range of applied
physiologic load conditions. Proving that the Evoke piezoelectric TLIF can accurately sense and output
physiologic load data, differentiating between varying loads expected in fusion progression, will de-risk the
integration of sensing and bone stimulating capabilities.
The results of this work will set the stage for Phase II funding to integrate and miniaturize the sensing and
stimulating circuits to create an integrated, dual mode stimulating and sensing spinal fusion implant. As part of
this phase II work, additional in vivo validation ovine studies will be completed to justify moving forward with
commercialization. Following, additional funding will be raised to complete the necessary verification and validation
testing along with early clinical trials required for expanded regulatory claims around addition of the sensing
capability of the TLIF implant. The thoracolumbar spine interbody market is over $1.4B/year with a compound
annual growth rate of 2.9%. The proposed device is hypothesized to increase success of healing and decrease
time to heal, as well as give patients and healthcare providers quantitative outcome measures without expensive
CT scans or biased patient self-reporting. This would decrease overall cost of care and human suffering, as
earlier, data driven post-operative decisions could be made, preventing a failed fusion and additional revision
surgeries."

infection and about 1.5 million people became newly infected just in 2020. A vaccine is critically needed to stop the AIDS
pandemic. Induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV-1 is the utmost critical goal towards the
development of a protective AIDS vaccine. In this R43 Phase I SBIR proposal, we will evaluate a novel “Antibody-
Stabilized, Epitope Presentation” (ASEP) vaccine strategy to elicit 10E8-like bnAbs against HIV-1. 10E8, a bnAb isolated
from an HIV-1-infected patient that targets the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV-1 gp41, has been shown
to neutralize ~98% of all HIV-1 isolates tested. Developing immunogens and/or establishing vaccine strategies that can
induce 10E8-like bnAbs would be a major milestone towards AIDS vaccine development. Thus, our proposal is highly
significant and, if successful, this project will have great impact in the AIDS vaccine field and immunogens we generate
will be commercially valuable. The major innovation and the focus of this proposal is our ASEP vaccine strategy, in which
precisely defined immune complexes are used as immunogens. This proposal is founded on three scientific premises. (1) A
vaccine that can induce high titers of 10E8-like bnAbs will be protective against HIV-1 infections. (2) Although short
peptides are good for focusing antibody responses, they are not ideal B-cell immunogens because they are highly flexible
and can exist in many different conformations. (3) The conformation of a peptide can be fixed into a rigid structure when it
is bound to an antibody. The primary objective of this Phase I R43 feasibility study is to demonstrate MPER/Antibody
immune complexes can be used to elicit 10E8-like bnAbs against HIV-1. Successful completion of this study would
overcome a critical roadblock towards development of a protective AIDS vaccine."

The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the need for enhanced ability to accurately
anticipate future outbreaks due to novel and endemic viral pathogens. Without systematic surveillance, the
ability to head off outbreaks before they occur is challenging: the data from positive human test results is often
too late to prevent a major outbreak from occurring, despite substantial lockdown efforts. The key reason for
this delay is that people are infectious for days before (and if) they are diagnosed positive. We can no longer
rely on population-based testing, which (a) is delayed; (b) is non-random and expensive, exacerbating well-
known and understood health disparities; and (c) relies on highly accurate, widely distributed test availability
and use. Over the last fourteen months, our team of affiliated scientists has developed and implemented a
wastewater-sampling approach to monitor for COVID-19 and other viral pathogens. Our approach utilizes
unique genomic signatures of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) to detect this pathogen in
wastewater, providing inexpensive and unbiased real-time data on COVID-19 infections in communities and
organizations. Our group has begun to contract with municipalities, academic entities and large manufacturing
companies to provide real-time, unbiased data on the presence of COVID-19. Currently, however, wastewater
COVID-19 data has primarily been used solely to determine the presence/absence of SARS-CoV-2 in
samples. We see a highly innovative and impactful opportunity to leverage these data further to anticipate the
timing, location, and severity of future outbreaks from SARS-CoV-2 and other novel and endemic viral
pathogens. The Superior Statistical Research (SSR) RandD team is an internationally recognized group of
wastewater and public health experts with cross-cutting expertise in statistics, data analysis, modelling,
computing, wastewater monitoring, and the ability to translate wastewater and health information into
actionable steps for organizations and communities. To address this opportunity, we propose a Phase I proof-
of-concept SBIR project with two Aims. First, we will demonstrate that it is possible to anticipate locations and
organizations with future outbreaks of COVID-19 with significant lead time. Second, we will demonstrate how
model predictions can be optimized to be useful for municipalities and organizations. Feasibility will be
determined by having models with excellent predictive ability (R2rt0.90) (Aim 1) and by demonstrating the
profitability of the commercialization pathway (Aim 2). Phase I feasibility will allow us to extend modelling
capabilities beyond SARS-CoV-2 to other viral pathogens (e.g., influenza, norovirus, HIV): expanding
wastewater testing capabilities for these additional pathogens, and further roll-out and improvement of the
machine-learning/modelling effort in Phase II. Ultimately, we will have a full-service commercial set of
predictive models (Phase III) that can be combined with wastewater-monitoring programs at the community
and organizational level, leading to dramatic reductions in viral disease outbreaks."

It overcomes the challenges of current viral screening methods, namely PPE required for collecting samples, handling of samples to centralized analytic sites, cost of tests, and reliance on limited reagents. The platform proposed in this project could be used on-site at an animal production facility or at home. The scanner can be placed at many municipal and commercial locations (e.g., drug stores) or the envelope can be conveniently mailed for assessment. The dual read modality gives timely feedback to the client, as well as the capability for anonymous aggregation of readout data - essential for real-time tracking of viral outbreak and informing resource allocation to mitigate spread. This diagnostic platform would generate impact, allowing: 1) animal producers to mitigate virus spread and reduce loss and 2) businesses, schools, and other organizations to make real-time data-driven decisions on closures and health policies. The proposed project focuses on assessing technical feasibility of three critical elements of a diagnostic platform: (1) the ability to couple isothermal RNA amplification directly to cell-free extract using custom formulations, to simplify usability (eliminate current off-card amplification with commercial kits) and reduce cost; (2) Production of a scalable and efficient cell-free extract well-suited for amplification of reporter proteins by RNA circuits to increase the rate of protein production and reduced RNA degradation. The performance of this extract will inform the time to result as well as the cost of card, necessary metrics for translation; and (3) production of new toehold riboregulators (2 to 3) selective to virus targets relevant to the animal industry (e.g., swine flu, porcine respiratory). These will also inform the limits of detection. This project will evaluate the feasibility of such as system. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A significant problem, yet to be addressed in the current design of knee braces, are the number of people that experience performance limitations while braced. Most knee brace frames incorporate standard bilateral, polycentric hinges which provide a stabilizing force to the flexion and extension of the knee.  While this method attempts to mimic the joint’s natural movement, it falls short in allowing the knee the ability to internally and externally rotate.  During the last 30° of extension, the tibia or femur must externally or internally rotate, approximately 10°. While this rotation may seem small, it remains essential for healthy motion of the knee and maximal performance.  Rotation must occur to achieve full flexion and extension. If the tibia or femur is held in a fixed position, this can alter the mechanics of the knee and lead to an increased chance of injury. By eliminating the joint’s ability to rotate, the brace begins to fight against the joint’s true motion, decreasing the ability of the athlete to move with fluidity and increasing the risk of brace migration and injury.  Military personnel have suggested that the current knee braces are bulky and difficult to wear underneath their uniform and lead to a loss of performance. This technology seeks to significantly reduce migration, increase comfort, provide customizable sizing, and ultimately allow for optimal performance."

While traditional diagnostic testing methods have progressed immensely in recent decades, there are still non-ideal aspects of common testing methods that prevent them from being more widely accessible2. For example, they are commonly analog (i.e., not always a simple yes/no result), use specialized equipment and require trained personnel. These lab diagnostics are also expensive and typically done in centralized labs, which requires time for transport and/or multi-day analysis as well complex sample preparation steps. In other words, for as far as we’ve come in recent decades, we still do not have diagnostic capabilities for most applications of need that can support in-field testing that is rapid, rugged, fast, affordable, reliable, and requires minimal user training. Relative to traditional molecular biology, spectroscopic, and other diagnostic technologies, electrochemistry-based sensors are well positioned to fill this market need and capability gap. Specifically, electrochemistry-based sensors have been shown to provide reliable, rugged, low-cost solutions for other applications. For example, electrochemical sensors are commonly used for smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, industrial gas sensors and other applications. However, electrochemistry-based detection and diagnostics for biological and healthcare applications are not yet common. This is an area of research that has been receiving increased attention from multiple research labs, including the well-known Whitesides Group’s uMed project at Harvard that demonstrated the capabilities of a low-cost portable and connected potentiostat with a cell phone using off the shelf screen printed electrodes (SPE).

Another part of this is that once we have dispersed the functionalized nanotubes in the grease base fluids, it is a stable solution that can be applied to the customers equipment as needed. Novel Nano Grease tribology testing revealed a 30% decrease in friction when compared to conventional greases.  Wear testing revealed a performance increase of 60% compared to conventional greases.  Novel Nano Grease has been prepared with thermal conductivity enhancements over the base fluid up to 545.9%.  A commercially available thermal silicone heat transfer compound from MG Chemicals showed thermal conductivity enhancements up to 143.3% with our novel addition of carbon nanomaterials.  In many cases the viscosity of the greases is not significantly changed.

High productivity demands and just-in-time approaches to manufacturing mean that equipment downtime can be extremely expensive; Research shows that the average manufacturer deals with 800 hours of downtime per year. Further, an increasing quantity of aging equipment and a maintenance workforce that is largely reaching retirement age have led to a situation where maintenance staff often lack the knowledge, training, and/or manpower to address a growing pool of aging assets. This project intends to bring forward a novel suite of intuitive and explainable technologies that can help reduce or eliminate unexpected downtime and help digitally capture and transfer expert knowledge from the retiring workforce. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes a novel, deep learning approach to machinery prognostics. Many existing deep learning approaches focus on the most likely failure scenarios given a set of training data. However, monitored equipment may not exbibit behavior covered in that training set, leading to low-confidence predictions. This approach will not only predict the remaining useful life of a machine component, but it will also quantify the uncertainty of a prediction through an ensemble of models and a temporal fusion of predictions. As a result, maintenance decisions can be made from a risk-based perspective, eliminating unnecessary maintenance stemming from low-confidence predictions. Furthermore, many existing deep learning approaches lack the ability to intuitively explain their predictions to human users. In critical applications where bad predictions have serious consequences, maintenance personnel must understand and trust an artificially intelligent predictive maintenance partner. The proposed solution produces an intuitive visual explanation for the model’s prediction by highlighting and animating the segments of a raw data signal that are contributing most significantly to the prediction. This will allow trained personnel to quickly make optimal maintenance decisions by fusing data-driven insights with their existing domain expertise.

needs LDCT, referred to as the PLCOM2012 mode, uses the often-unreliable variable of self-reported cigarette
consumption. However, Behavioral Diagnostics has developed an epigenetic assay that objectively determines
smoking intensity. Using a similar, yet less precise quantitative PCR assay, Bojesen and colleagues studied
2,576 LDCT screening-eligible smokers in the Copenhagen City Study. They found that DNA methylation status
at cg05575921 strongly predicted which smokers would benefit from LDCT screening. Indeed, in their study,
this epigenetic marker of smoking outperformed the entire PLCOM2012 model in predicting cancer risk and
showed that over 20% of those who would normally qualify for LDCT screening had no prospect of benefitting
from screening.In this R43 proposal, we will measure cg05575921 methylation in 3200 subjects from the NLST and test
whether incorporating cg05575921 methylation status into the PLCOM2012 lung cancer risk model improves
prediction. We hypothesize that DNA methylation at cg05575921 will predict lung cancer occurrence and identify
a population of smokers who are unlikely to benefit from LDCT screening. This project will have high commercial
impact because it may lead to a marked decrease in unnecessary screening. The team is highly qualified. It is
led by the CEO of Behavioral Diagnostics who invented the assay and the company controls all necessary IP.
He will be assisted by Dr. Jeff Long, a biostatistician with an international reputation for conducting biomarker
analyses, and a team of pulmonologists, ethicists and other scientists. It is innovative because epigenetic
screening is relatively new to cancer screening. It is feasible because the DNA and clinical information has
already been collected. If successful, the pathway to the R44 extension, and eventually the clinic, is clear-cut
because the assay is already manufactured under GMP conditions, the digital PCR platform is already 510K
approved, we have collaborators have experience with the FDA submission process, and the economics driving
market adaption are already in place.Narrative
The purpose of this application is to determine whether a simple DNA methylation test can help determine
whether a smoker should undergo low dose CT screening for Lung Cancer and if this methylation test can help
predict risk for cancer."

We
also lag other OECD nations in math and science skills. Better STEM education is needed that engages,
prepares, and inspires K-12 students—especially under-represented groups. 21st Century STEM jobs require
solid STEM content knowledge along with problem-solving/critical thinking skills and teamwork. Collaborative,
game-based bioengineering learning experiences have the potential to meet these STEM-related needs and to
prepare more people of all types for health science jobs. However, innovations are required to boost
implementation, reduce cost, and enhance authenticity/realism and K-12 student engagement. A key aspect of
our STEM deficit is our failure to give students foundational math/science skills and to convey their real-world
relevance. Project-based learning (PBL) and engineering in K-12 can achieve this, but is currently limited by
instructional time, teacher training, project resource costs, and difficulty in evaluating engaging, project-based
experiences. Research shows that team STEM collaboration and application to community problems improve
STEM outcomes—especially for under-represented groups. Yet access to programs and experiences that meld
these two features with instruction is limited; common PBL lacks sufficient realism for upper-level high school
learning; and innovative, cost-effective solutions that are self-paced, easy to implement, and that support
collaboration are not yet available. In response to these needs, this multi-phase SBIR project will capitalize on
strong preliminary work/data to develop, validate, and commercialize a game-based bioengineering tool called
Mimetics and Medically Inspired Classroom Engineering (MiMCRE). As envisioned, it will employ applied math
and science in the design, analysis, and simulation of bioengineering- and biomimicry-focused projects. Students
will collaboratively design prosthetics, apply math and science models to evaluate them, and then 3D-print and
test outcomes in the real world. MiMICRE will be sold into high school, post-secondary, and informal Ed. markets.
Our STEM application team will work with bioengineering, diversity, and evaluation consultants and engineering
software industry partners to pursue three proof-of-concept Phase I Aims: 1) Show the feasibility of integrating
commercial tools for CAD and computational analysis with a game-based bioengineering environment for STEM;
2) Show the functionality of a biomedical engineering project in MiMICRE to engage teams of students, support
prototyping, and connect to NGSS and CCSS math standards; and 3) Test MiMICRE with students. Success in
verifying usability via a System Usability Score, feasibility of implementation by completing challenges during
typical class sessions, and time, support for effective collaboration using group interaction and digital design-
sharing, and improved outcomes with statistically significant knowledge increases will set the stage for a larger
Phase II demonstration—during which we will add to the diversity of biomimetic/bioengineering projects, add
support for post-secondary applications, refine the prototype, and conduct more-rigorous MiMICRE evaluation.Project Narrative
Over three-quarters of todayandapos;s ten fastest-growing occupations require a background in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM), yet nearly two-thirds of U.S. students entering high school scored below
the proficient level in math on the 2017 National Assessment of Educational Progress; furthermore, women,
African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and disadvantaged individuals continue to be underrepresented as a
percentage of the STEM workforce. Innovative, affordable project-based STEM education is needed in high
schools to engage, inspire, and prepare all students (and especially underrepresented groups) with 21st Century
STEM skills, realistic and authentic simulation tools, and collaboration skills, so that increased representation is
possible for all students in STEM-based health science careers. The overall goal of this project is to develop,
test, and commercialize MiMICRE, a game-based bioengineering design tool that will more effectively teach
math and science to all high school students through a gamified, project-based learning platform."

Many cancers are recognized to have an inflammatory etiology. Gastric cancer, the third leading cause of cancer
deaths worldwide, is the prototype- it is caused by infection with the bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori in
90% of cases. For colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths, inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) is a frequent precursor lesion. This STTR Phase I proposal is a partnership between the Wilson
Lab at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), which is focused on gastrointestinal inflammation-
associated carcinogenesis, and MTI BioTech, Inc. (MTI), who are together developing a new therapeutic strategy
to prevent cancer. Under conditions of chronic mucosal inflammation, increased enzyme activities result in
formation of dicarbonyl electrophiles, products of lipid peroxidation that include isolevuglandins (isoLGs),
malondialdehyde, 4-oxo-nonenal, and acrolein, all of which can form adducts with DNA, histones, and proteins.
This adduct formation may lead to somatic genomic abnormalities and risk for neoplastic transformation. The
compound 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA) can serve as a scavenger of all electrophiles, thus preventing
adduct formation. 2-HOBA is a natural product derived from buckwheat seeds. It has been shown to be highly
bioavailable, with no toxicity, in rodents and in recent human Phase I clinical trials. 2-HOBA protects mice from
oxidative damage in models of hypertension and Alzheimer’s disease. The Wilson Lab has discovered that isoLG
adducts are increased i) in gastric tissues of patients and mice infected with H. pylori; ii) in the colon of humans
with chronic colitis from inflammatory bowel disease, and colitis-associated cancer (CAC), and mice treated with
azoxymethane-dextran sulfate sodium (AOM-DSS), a model of CAC. The Lab has found that a 2-HOBA analog,
EtHOBA, which also scavenges electrophiles, markedly reduces gastric dysplasia and carcinoma in two models
of H. pylori-induced gastric carcinoma, transgenic FVB/N insulin-gastrin (INS-GAS) mice and Mongolian gerbils,
and reduces colonic tumorigenesis in the AOM-DSS CAC model. However, unlike 2-HOBA, EtHOBA has not
reached development for human use. We hypothesize that electrophiles have a key role in inflammation-driven
gastrointestinal carcinogenesis via formation of adducts to macromolecules and are new molecular targets for
cancer prevention by 2-HOBA. We will determine the protective effect of 2-HOBA on H. pylori-induced gastric
carcinogenesis in INS-GAS mice and gerbils (Aim 1) and on colitis-associated carcinogenesis in the AOM-DSS
mouse model (Aim 2). Primary endpoints will be reduction in dysplasia, carcinoma, and tumor formation, and
secondary endpoints will be effects on DNA damage and isoLG adducts. A successful STTR Phase I outcome
will be a protective effect of 2-HOBA on gastric and colon carcinogenesis and will be the primary go/no go
endpoint to a Phase II STTR project. We envision future studies testing 2-HOBA in animals in which disease is
already fully established; further assessment of molecular mechanisms underlying protective effects, including
in human organoids; and human clinical trials in patients with precancerous gastric and colon lesions.NARRATIVE:
Many human cancers are caused by chronic inflammation, and this is especially true in the gastrointestinal tract,
where most cases of stomach cancer are caused by a bacterial infection with Helicobacter pylori and colorectal
cancer is often caused by inflammatory bowel disease, due to colitis-associated carcinogenesis. Our data
implicate a novel pathway for gastrointestinal cancer development due to oxidative injurious agents called
electrophiles, and we hypothesize that removing these electrophiles with 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA), a
natural product from buckwheat seeds, will reduce development of stomach and colon cancer in rodent models.
This Phase I partnership between MTI BioTech, Inc. (MTI), the developer of 2-HOBA for future commercial use,
and the Wilson Lab at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where the animal experiments and subsequent
analyses will be conducted, is expected to provide essential preclinical data needed for future Phase II studies
with 2-HOBA defining molecular mechanisms of protection and for human clinical trials in patients at high risk
for inflammation-induced stomach and colorectal cancer."

Although the ubiquity of metabolic problems in pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been known for more than a
decade, a wealth of new details on the nature of this problem presents the opportunity for intervention. A
combination of experimental work in cells and animals and early trials in humans, suggests that these
metabolic problems are part of the causation for PH, and that inactivation of the mitochondrial lysine
deacetylase SIRT3 is a central node in regulating the metabolic defects. A vicious cycle exists in which a
triggering event or mutation increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), which produces reactive lipids, which
adduct and inactivate SIRT3, causing metabolic changes that result in further increased ROS. Here, we break
this cycle using 2-HOBA, a small molecule which can effectively soak up reactive lipids in vivo and has positive
results in safety trials for other indications in humans, with some still ongoing. Effectiveness of 2-HOBA has
already been established for the prevention of PH in mice, and the mechanism suggests it should be effective
for reversal. Here, we prepare for human trials of 2-HOBA by testing its efficacy for reversal of established
disease in two molecularly accurate mouse models alone or in combination with metformin, and by examining
serum biomarkers of disease shared between humans and mice for early indications of response which can be
used to guide human trials.NARRATIVE
The literature and our preliminary data support the hypothesis that the metabolic defects that are required for
progression of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) are caused in part of by inactivation of key proteins by adduction
of reactive lipids. These reactive lipids can be blocked by 2-HOBA, a compound already undergoing safety
testing for other indications in human patients. In this project, we test the ability of 2-HOBA alone, or in addition
to metformin, to reverse established disease in two mouse models, and determine biomarkers of early
response which will help guide human clinical trials."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, yet no effective therapeutic intervention is available
for those in prodromal and early stages of AD. Restoration of functional and cognitive resilience in early disease
stages is especially beneficial in many aspects as it could substantially extend the period of quality of life and
delay the clinical onset of AD. In search of therapeutic targets for early disease stages, recent studies uncover
a significant loss of TH+ neurons in locus coeruleus (LC) in patients with MCI and very early stages of AD. These
neurons project to the hippocampus, where monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA) and
norepinephrine (NE), modulate synaptic plasticity and neuronal functions relevant to memory and cognition.
Thus, restoration of DA and NE levels in the hippocampus could retain cognitive resilience during early stages
of AD. L-DOPA is a brain penetrating precursor drug for DA to treat Parkinson’s disease. Its therapeutic potency
on AD has not been well investigated in humans in part due to lack of understanding in the pathological
involvement of DA and NE in AD and development of neurobehavioral side-effects for frequent and long-term
use. We, therefore, propose to comprehensively evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of L-DOPA by a novel method
of administration in the mouse model recapitulating early stage of AD phenotypes. Unlike the traditional oral
administration of L-DOPA multiple times a day, which results in fluctuation of L-DOPA in plasma and induces
toxicity, we will give engineered commensal bacteria that produce L-DOPA (EcNrhaL-DOPA) in a sustained and non-
pulsatile manner. Single administration of EcNrhaL-DOPA transiently resides in the gut for a couple of days and
supply L-DOPA without disrupting the gut microbiota. This approach could effectively mitigate fluctuation-
mediated side-effects and L-DOPA toxicity and maximize its therapeutic effects to restore brain DA and NE
levels. As a first step towards evaluating its therapeutic benefits in the relevant AD mouse model, we propose
to optimize the treatment regimen and dosage of EcNrhaL-DOPA administration in APP-KI and wildtype mice and to
evaluate pharmacokinetics and any adverse toxicological effects in this application. The overall impact and
translational significance of this proposed study are extremely high as this approach could not only work
complementally with currently available drugs to treat AD but also significantly slow the progression of AD
phenotypes from early stages to prevent conversion to full spectrum of AD. This novel technology is covered
under USPTO Application # 20190262298, titled “L-DOPA microbiome therapy”.PROJECT NARRATIVE
There is no effective treatment to alleviate neurobehavioral and memory decline for patients with MCI or early
stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent studies highlight a substantial loss of monoamine neurotransmitter
inputs into the hippocampus during the early disease course and their contributions to cognitive functions,
suggesting that restoration of monoamine neurotransmitters has significant therapeutic values to treat such
symptoms. In this application, we will optimize the dosing regimen of our novel biogenic drug delivery system
using commensal gut bacteria to give L-DOPA in a non-pulsatile manner in a mouse model of AD and assess
pharmacokinetics and toxicity, in order to evaluate this as one of potential treatment strategy for AD."

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has recommended thatmajor wheat yield improvements must play a key role to ensure future global food security.Experts agree the most promising way to improve wheat yields is to capture the higher productivityand vigor associated with hybridity.Despite 60+ years of effort by the seed industry to develophybrid wheat as a commercial product all the U.S. wheat acreage is still planted to self-pollinatedvarieties. Failure to ensure timely and intended cross-pollinations renders production of hybrid®
wheat seed extremely inefficient and cost prohibitive. Our PowerPollen technology to preserve®
and apply viable pollen on-demand is changing this paradigm.Developing a PowerPollen systemfor wheat presents significant technical challenges due to the short life of pollen and feasibility ofcollecting sufficient pollen for on-demand pollinations. We are seeking to overcome theselimitations by developing novel technologies to extract large volumes of highly viable pollendirectly from anthers collected from excised wheat spikes. The goal of this Phase I SBIR projectis to prove the feasibility of developing a scalable technology for collecting large volumes of viablewheat pollen.This engineering achievement is essential to enable on-demand pollination andrevolutionize hybrid wheat seed production.The research objectives are: (1) Prove the feasibilityof designing/constructing a scalable method for mechanically harvesting male wheat spikescontaining mature viable pollen (2) Construct a scalable prototype to validate the concept ofseparating anthers containing viable pollen from green plant material and (3) Develop and provean efficient method of liberating viable pollen grains from intact wheat anthers for subsequentconditioning and storage.Anticipated Results and Potential Commercial Applications:®
Our preliminary data show that PowerPollen technology extends the viability of wheat pollendramatically.Pollen with the highest viability resides in anthers which can be isolated from theflowers mechanically.We anticipate the novel methods being evaluated in this Phase I projectwill provide sufficient volumes of viable wheat pollen to enable bulk storage and field-scaleevaluation of on-demand applications in Phase II.We have existing relationships with major seed®companies and have demonstrated the value of PowerPollen in maize under commercial fieldconditions.Our communications with leadership in the hybrid wheat industry and wheat breedersconfirm that current hybrid wheat production systems result in only about 40 to 50% seed set dueto inadequate pollinations.The cost to produce hybrid seed using cytoplasmic male sterility isabout $1000 per hectare; the cost is more than double that value using gametocide to inducesterility.A productive female inbred allowed to self-pollinate can produce 6 tons/hectare.If sowell-managed hybrid system requiring 35% male inbred achieving 50% seed set would yield about®
2 tons per hectare under favorable conditions. Assuming conservatively that a PowerPollenapplication can result in 75% seed set this would result in a 50% increase in hybrid seed yield to®
3 tons per hectare.At a COGS for hybrid wheat seed of $500/ton the value add for PowerPollenin this scenario is about $500 per hectare.A licensing/royalty fee that captures 25% of this valuewould equate to $125 of revenue per hectare.The value add would be more than double forgametocide-based systems and if the area allocated to male inbreds could be decreased. Using this®
model and projected market penetration we expect significant revenue for wheat PowerPollenwithin 5 years after completion of this Phase I project with revenues reaching $38MM for 10%marke"

Benefits will include protection against intermittent lubrication, an increase in the time-between-overhauls, and reduced system cost.  Application of a thicker PEO-coating and a thicker PEMS nanocoating, may enable oil-less engine operation, thereby reducing maintenance costs and increasing system reliability. Characterization and testing of the coated coupons will include coating thickness verification, surface-roughness measurements, coating-morphology evaluations, and screening friction-wear tribological tests to enable down-selection to one of the mature SwRI coatings (DLC or TiSiCN) for contact with the PEO-converted Al-Si material.  This will enable a selection of the best ring-coating and cylinder coating for further testing (e.g., PLINT ring-section vs. cylinder section AND engine-testing) and characterization in Phase II.  Coordination with a major UAV engine-manufacturer, Northwest UAV, will be performed early in Phase I, to obtain engine component requirements, e.g., specific materials selection, dimensional tolerances, surface finish, expected operating conditions, etc..  This unique PEO manufacturing technology has application to numerous DoD needs, including replacement of toxic hard Chrome plate for corrosion protection of critical hardware, ablative-liners for gun-barrel life extension, and rotorcraft sliding-seat hardware interfaces. "

CAFOs emit many volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere. Current multi-gas sensor technologies are not sufficiently portable and are utilized either offline in a lab-setting or driven around in a mobile lab to monitor VOC emissions around CAFOs. The lack of portability limits the spatial distribution information for VOCs in CAFOs. This poor understanding of VOC sources hinders the development of management practices that reduce VOC emissions in animal feeding facilities. Thus, a portable and cost-effective spectrometry technology is needed for comprehensive characterization of VOC sources and their relative importance within a CAFO. In this EPA SBIR Phase I project, we propose to develop an uncooled portable gas spectrometer operating in the midinfrared (MIR) wavelength range of 2.5 µm to 5.0 µm that utilizes our high performance superlattice light emitting diodes (SLEDs) and photodetector (PD) technologies. The proposed spectrometer utilizes a dispersive design and does not include any moving parts enabling a rugged design that can be deployed in the field. In addition, given the compact formfactor of the spectrometer, it can be placed at several locations within the CAFO with each of the spectrometer wirelessly networked to the other. Our previous work in developing high performance MIR LEDs and detectors builds our confidence in the ability to accomplish the proposed objectives in Phase I. Increasing awareness about outdoor and indoor air pollution, and companion regulations protecting air quality issued by the U.S. EPA and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) are key factors driving the portable spectrometer market growth. Industrial applications such as real-time monitoring of pipelines, monitoring of benzene leaks, and remote monitoring of plant equipment are additional factors driving market growth. Leveraging Firefly Photonics value proposition, we plan on capturing 30% of the Service Addressable Market (SAM) in 2030 yielding a Service Obtainable Market (SOM) valued at $40M. Our MIR LED’s broadband, high power emission makes it possible to achieve ppb limit of detection (LoD) sensing, while utilizing a dispersive spectrometer design, with no moving parts. Additionally our MIR PD delivers worlds class uncooled detectivity enabling uncooled spectrometer operation. The portable spectrometer technology developed in this project will have far reaching impact on a number of environmental monitoring applications."

Salmonella bacteria are the most frequently reported cause of foodborne illness. Food contamination in processing facilities can lead to serious public health problems as well as costly recalls of millions of food units. Rapid and accurate sensing technology is currently lacking for definitive detection of Salmonella in food-processing plants, which delays initiation of appropriate control measures and increases the likelihood of spreading contamination and foodborne illnesses to consumers. This technology will enable more frequent testing throughout the entire manufacturing process at reduced costs. It is fully expected that this technology could be applied to the detection of other pathogens. The proposed project will create and test a rapid (20 minutes), hand-held, sensitive (1 bacteria cell per milliliter) platform to enable food-processing facilities to detect Salmonella on site. The innovation of this technology lies in the ability to avoid bacterial enrichment (22 to 48 hours to allow bacteria to grow), while still sensitively and selectively detecting Salmonella species. The device uses a testing cartridge to bring bacteria directly to a detection surface, which consists of graphene printed or scribed on a test-strip and subsequently functionalized with Salmonella-specific antibodies. Unique laser processing induces a 3D-structured surface at the nanoscale level in graphene that becomes highly conductive for biosensing and for antibody attachment, which are desirable properties for enabling low detection limits and increasing test sensitivity. These technologies can be combined into a portable platform to make a user-friendly handheld biosensor and displaying quantitative counts of bacteria. The integrated platform (test strip and cartridge) will be designed to interface with existing portable electrical readers in much the same fashion that diabetics monitor blood glucose levels at home with a blood test strip that connects to a portable reader with a digital display.

This project aims to develop a skincare product to prevent ultraviolet (UV)-induced skin cancer with a novel
antioxidant delivery system, Pro-NP™, for topical application alone or as an additive to commercial sunblock.
Skin cancer is more common than all other cancers combined and affects millions of Americans every year. UV
exposure from the sun or tanning beds causes the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which
overwhelms the skin’s natural antioxidant defense and leads to oxidative stress, photoaging, and skin cancer.
While commercial sunscreens can reduce the risk of developing skin cancer, they are poor at blocking UV-A
rays responsible for most of the cutaneous ROS production. The topical application of exogenous antioxidants
could potentially combat UV generated ROS; however, in their native state, many antioxidants are too unstable
to absorb to the deeper layers of the skin effectively. The natural defense system of the skin against UV-induced
oxidative stress includes antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), essential enzymes that
neutralize the detrimental effects of ROS. Unfortunately, the catalytic activity of native SOD and CAT are short-
lived and rapidly cleared, a limiting factor on current therapeutic strategies based on exogenous delivery.
ProTransit has developed a proprietary antioxidant delivery system, Pro-NP™, specially formulated for the slow-
sustained release of SOD and CAT, to overcome the limitation of the antioxidant’s short half-life. The
development of our dermatological product capitalizes on the recent advances of nanotechnology to overcome
the biological barriers of using antioxidants to counteract skin damage caused by ROS. Our preliminary studies
are promising and demonstrate that Pro-NP is non-toxic in humans and penetrates to the deepest layers of
the skin to release active SOD and CAT, reduces DNA damage after UV exposure, and prevents the degradation
of essential skin protein fibers like elastin and collagen. The overall objective of this study is to optimize the
formulation of plant-based SOD and CAT in Pro-NP, determine the window of efficacy, compare the
effectiveness of Pro-NP to commercially available sunscreens, and evaluate the potential of co-application of
Pro-NP with commercial sunscreens. Our long-term goal is to develop novel, next-generation skincare
products for topical application to prevent UV-induced skin damage and ultimately to reduce the incidence of
skin cancer.NARRATIVE

For those with type 1 diabetes, the wait for a cell therapy to control blood glucose without systemic
immunosuppression has been long and disappointing. While recent commercial acquisitions for such
cell therapies offer hope that the field is finally advancing, there will be a need for numerous options,
much like the approach to the COVID vaccine. Likarda holds multiple patents surrounding our novel
microplates used for differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into insulin-producing cells and
around our unique encapsulation technology that allows us to use biocompatible hydrogels that are not
available to traditional microencapsulation approaches. We have differentiated clinically-appropriate
human pluripotent cells into insulin-producing cells (Insulin-Producing induced Pluripotent Stem Cells
– IPiPSCs) using our 5-step protocol that incorporates few growth factors compared to published
protocols and can reverse diabetes in immune-compromised mice. We have encapsulated islets in a
PEG-based hydrogel and reversed diabetes in immune-competent rats for their lifespan without
immunosuppression or exogenous insulin. However, the IPiPSCs did not function well in the PEG-
based hydrogel. Preliminary data indicates that a new hydrogel formulation we have created based on
thiolated hyaluronic acid (ThHA) is a better match for the IPiPSCs. The purpose of this project is to
examine the ability of ThHA to durably reverse diabetes in rats with a pilot trial in diabetic dogs. The
specific aims are: 1) Identify genetic stability of the IPiPSCs after encapsulation and implantation into
diabetic rats; 2) Determine whether implantation of ThHA-encapsulated human IPiPSCs in diabetic
rats and beagles arrests the clinical signs of diabetes; 3) Identify biomarkers of a possible foreign body
reaction in the surrounding tissue at 2 wks, 3 and 9 mos post-transplant int diabetic rats and 6 mos in
diabetic dogs. Once we confirm the optimal hydrogel formulation for the IPiPSCs, we will incorporate
them into our ribbon device, a retrievable device that maintains the large surface area and low diffusion
barrier characteristics of microspheres while delivering retrievability for regulatory requirements. At the
completion of this Phase I feasibility study, we will undergo Phase II studies in spontaneously diabetic
dogs, which are an optimal model for human T1D due to parallel clinical presentation, similar
autoantibodies, pathology and complications. Promising long-term results in spontaneously-diabetic
dogs would offer strong preclinical data for human clinical trials.The key to a successful treatment of type 1 diabetes requires both insulin-producing cells and a
way to protect them from immune rejection by the recipient’s body. We have both clinically
appropriate stem cells that we have differentiated into insulin-producing cells and a hydrogel to
coat the cells so that they are protected from the immune system. This proposal will test the
combination of the two in diabetic rats and dogs to determine whether they can reverse
hyperglycemia and the clinical signs of diabetes without insulin shots and without
immunosuppression."

Accurate soil information is a fundamental driver of better, more efficient crop/soil management. The new technology would significantly increase farm profitability, lower food costs, and improve environmental protection and sustainability. Making higher quality soil fertility mapping readily available and usable is the goal of this project. This technology is expected to result in increased crop yield while allowing for decreased input costs, leading to higher profits in an industry that chronically suffers from low profit margins. The expected benefits include more environmentally responsible farm management and better manure-management planning, nutrient-management planning, precision farming, land use planning, planting decisions, evaluating stressors on plants, field conditioning, crop rotation, and prediction/interpretation of yields. These will result in increased farm profitability, more efficient application of nitrogen fertilizers, and increased soil health and fertility for plants. This project advances an innovative technology has three key components to produce maps of essential soil nutrients in training fields and beyond — maps that currently require extensive sampling while producing inadequate data. The first is a digital hill-slope position to select optimal sampling locations to represent the soil variability across the landscape, eliminating the need to take unnecessary soil samples. The second element leverages advanced machine-learning algorithms insensitive to the quantity of sample size. The third element is its ability to select suitable remotely sensed information (terrain derivatives and satellite imagery). The technology will select appropriate analysis scales of terrain derivatives to capture all potential soil variability. It will then select and use proper bands of satellite imagery, based on spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution, to decrease the risks of overfitting and computation time. Unlike currently available methods, this technology can predict the soil nutrients inside the training fields and beyond — i.e., this technology has the potential to predict soil properties in neighboring fields — using the soil information obtained from training fields—without the need for additional samples. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A turnkey drop-in solution will be identified, designed and laid out utilizing CAE (computer aided engineering) such as CATIA V6  and proof given of its feasibility and performance capability via such advanced stress analysis tools as finite element modeling (FEM) analysis as well as lab accelerated corrosion tests confirming its corrosion resistance. This approach it is felt would result in the optimal solution to satisfy the Navy's need as it will very easily be integrated by following the current maintenance procedure, with little change, for replacing a corroded tie-down with a new one by welding it in place, The only changes are the new tie-down will be one made of a new novel metal superalloy that is impervious to corrosion and which meets all strength requirements and the weld location and heat affected zones will be moved to a noncritical location so the crossbars will be unaffected in strength retaining their full 185 KSI ultimate tensile and 150 KSI yield strengths and yet the functional geometry of the tie downs will remain unchanged. Due to the superalloy being much greater in strength than the old AISI 4130 tie-downs no change in the size, geometry or shape would be necessary of the functional portion of the geometry. This means there is the added advantage that all interfacing tie-down fittings ( hook and chain assembly that attach tie downs to aircraft) can retain their exact size, geometry and shape too - no learning curve would be needed for flight crew personnel because the replacement design would for all intents and purposes seem identical to the users. It is felt such a solution is closest to an optimal one possible. The result will be durable tie downs never needing replacement that have a higher load capacity to the ones they replace. During phase 1 research and development a couple variations of this approach will be considered and finalized with proof of concept being provided by lab tests and CAE and FEM (finite element modeling) engineering work in preparation for building a prototype during phase 2 work and delivering to the Navy for their verification tests. Later in phase 3 we will assist the Navy in integrating these new tie-downs and a product will be commercialized and made available to the general public."

Aquaculture farming operations are commonly located in regions with high solar intensity, but because traditional daytime energy costs are extremely high in these regions, many industry best practices are not economically feasible. This project addresses these problems by developing bolt-on equipment to augment existing floating aeration systems on fish farms with solar power and variable speed drives. Our innovation will reduce the speed of the aeration paddlewheels during daytime hours to enable circulation and destratification of the pond water layers without releasing oxygen from the supersaturated top layer and will use solar power to avoid the higher daytime power costs from using electricity from the grid. During Phase I of this project, FarmAfield Labs LLC will: 1) Work with industry experts to model power requirements and operating conditions for daytime pond destratification using pre-existing floating aeration paddlewheels; 2) Build a prototype of a complete system to be installed on existing floating aeration equipment; and 3) Use our prototype results to estimate system sizing, capital requirements, and payback periods for typical fish farms. By enabling a cost-effective way for fish producers to run daytime circulators on their farms, our innovation will facilitate significant nighttime aeration energy cost savings. Furthermore, our innovation will enable a much more in-depth study of the productivity and growth efficiency improvements that result from proper destratification methods. While we believe the energy cost savings alone make this a commercially viable innovation, these secondary benefits hold the potential to boost production capabilities of fish farms around the world."

infects the urogenital, anorectal and pharyngeal tracts in humans. In 2018, there were an estimated 1.14M
cases in the US, and 86.9M cases worldwide. Of concern is the growing incidence of antimicrobial resistance
not only due to inappropriate use of antibiotics, but also because NG interacts with and acquires genetic
material from other co-infections in the anatomical sites that it infects. This wide range of resistance
mechanisms that NG isolates can potentially harbor makes it very challenging to develop rapid molecular
methods of Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing (AST). Even among phenotypic AST methods, it has so far not
been considered feasible to perform automated broth microdilution based ASTs on NG: principally because it
is a fastidious organism in liquid culture. As a result, the primary method used to perform ASTs for NG is the
manual agar dilution method, which (because it is so labor intensive) is currently conducted in only a very
limited number of public health labs. Even these labs test only 200-300 samples a month.
Acenxion Biosystems proposes to develop the first fully automated NG phenotypic AST platform that both
satisfies the current CDC guidance for surveillance and fulfils an unmet clinical need for AST-guided “directed”
antibiotic therapy. Our instrument will provide Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Susceptible/
Intermediate /Resistance (S/I/R) interpretation in lt 6 hours with minimal sample preparation (lt5 min per
sample) at a reasonable price. The instrument will consist of stackable, cassette reader units with up to eight
microfluidic cassette capacity; software/PC Controller; and single-use consumable (50-well microfluidic
cassette pre-spotted with candidate antibiotics). Optimized broth and rapid stirring are employed for NG
growth, enabling automated broth microdilution. With prior funding from the CDC, we have demonstrated
proof-of-concept for the proposed instrument by building a partly-automated system to perform broth micro-
dilution experiments on a single 16-well cassette, and used it monitor the growth (or lack thereof) of 3 NG
strains (1 ATTC QC strain, and 2 AR isolate strains) in the presence of multiple candidate antibiotics with
100% sensitivity and specificity. We seek “Direct to Phase II” funds to expand this earlier work: build a fully
automated instrument and test it against the CDC’s challenge AR bank panel of 50 clinical isolates (which span
multiple resistance mechanisms and yield wide range of phenotypic responses). We chose this set of
organisms in lieu of patient samples from 2 - 3 locations to ensure better chances of success in the real world.
Our commercialization strategy aims to first bring efficiencies to the existing market (regional labs participating
in the Gonococcal Isolate Survey Program) and then to expand the user (customer) base to hospital labs,
clinical laboratory networks and clinical labs by enabling AST-guided directed antibiotic therapy for gonorrhea."

during 2017 is over 5 million in the U.S. alone. The significant increase of opioids use disorder (OUD) cases
during the last 2 decades may be partially attributed to our overreliance on the prescription of the opioids for the
management of non-cancer chronic pain, such as osteoarthritis (OA) pain. The extensive use of opioids for pain
management can be associated with a variety of side effects including constipation, nausea, dizziness, vomiting,
liver damage, respiratory depression leading to brain damage due to the hypoxia, and physical dependence,
tolerance and addiction. The higher dose prescription because of the physical dependence and tolerance
leading to OUD and the intertwined heroin use related with the addiction have been reported. Therefore, the
goals of the project are to develop, translate and commercialize a novel non-opioid therapy for sustained,
effective, safe management of OA pain, and to prevent opioids use disorder among osteoarthritis patients.Through an innovative structural design, we have developed a N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA)
copolymer-dexamethasone (Dex) prodrug (P-Dex-H) that is a free-flowing aqueous solution at reduced
temperature, but becomes a hydrogel (ProGel) when the temperature is raised to rt 30 °C. This
thermoresponsive phase transition property allows the macromolecular prodrug formulation to be deposited in
the synovial cavity with sustained presence for a protracted period of time. With continuous exposure to the
synovial fluid, we have shown that the ProGel can then gradually solubilize and release after which it is
internalized by synovial phagocytic cells and activated subcellularly to release Dex. In the preliminary studies,
we have found that the P-Dex-H-based ProGel was able to provide sustained (rt 1 month) amelioration to the
joint pain models of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA), monoarticular adjuvant-induced arthritis (MAA) and
monoiodoacetate-induced osteoarthritis (MIA). Furthermore, typical glucocorticoid side effects, such as
osteopenia, adrenal gland atrophy were not associated with ProGel treatment. Injection site reactions (e.g.,
arthralgia), as seen in the case of Flexion Therapeutics’ Zilretta™ (triamcinolone acetonide extended-release
formulation) was also absent in animals treated with ProGel. However, ProGel formulations have not been
evaluated in a clinically relevant osteoarthritis model such as the surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus
(DMM) mouse model. Therefore, in the Phase I of this fast-track project, we propose to test the feasibility of
using ProGel to treat arthritis pain in the DMM mouse model. A thorough physicochemical characterization,
including the construction of the phase diagram for ProGel will also completed in preparation for the optimization
of the formulation. For Phase II, we proposed to optimize the ProGel formulation by adjusting a variety of
structural parameters with the goal of identifying an optimized formulation with the most potent and sustained
joint pain amelioration and minimal toxicity. The IND enabling PK/BD study of this optimized ProGel formulation
will then be performed. The successful completion of the proposed research will help the ProGel technology to
become IND ready for further clinical evaluation."

The Principal Investigator (PI) at SFL brings experience in a variety of computational modeling regimes for process simulations, years of research and review of the DoD and its contractors in technical and contractual performance, and personal knowledge of operation as a small defense subcontractor. The Co-PI at Purdue is a world expert in collaborative innovation research who brings knowledge of the effects of both economic and non-economic business incentive factors, and is well experienced in computational modeling to identify emergent behaviors in complex adaptive systems.  The proposed work entails using a structured literature review and other methods to identify the factors affecting the incentives that drive firms to participate in and perform efficiently on DoD research and development (R&D) contracts. The research will specifically identify overlooked or underutilized factors that could encourage broader participation in DoD R&D initiatives. As factors are identified, the team will incorporate them into computational models that have strengths in identifying unrecognized emergent behaviors, and in simulating the effects of complex process interrelationships. We plan to have working prototype computational models before the end of the performance period, exceeding the solicitation goal to have only a notional system design.  We anticipate that the resulting computational models will be field-testable at the end of Phase I. This field testing may comprise applications deployed on government-owned personal computing equipment, and we also have a plan for and experience in creating a cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) solution in Phase II. Either approach will allow use of the real-time models in actual or simulated negotiations, and will provide the means to evolve the models based on findings and user feedback. The cloud-based solutions have the additional advantage of centralizing and simplifying deployment, operation, cybersecurity, and upgrades of the computational models, and allowing them to be accessed through already-approved web browser interfaces from government-owned equipment. "

New
approaches are emerging with the power to identify differences between individual cells that are not detectable
in studies of entire populations. One approach, called single‐cell RNA‐seq, has rapidly been adopted in the
scientific community. Single‐cell RNA‐seq is now increasingly performed simultaneously with the
measurement of protein levels. Recent technologies use DNA‐labeled antibodies to measure levels of 10‐100
proteins in the context of a genome‐wide analysis. However, these technologies have not yet been widely
adopted because of the cost and effort required and the relatively small number of proteins that can be measured.
Significant cost and effort are required to prepare DNA‐labeled antibodies which have limited commercial
availability. Furthermore, results with antibodies are sometimes imprecise because antibodies have multiple
binding sites for their targets and multiple conjugation sites for their DNA‐label.
We propose to develop a technology platform optimized for DNA‐based detection of proteins in single‐cell
experiments. The core of our platform is a potent and selective single domain antibody mimetic called a
nanoCLAMP that can be customized for specific applications and produced inexpensively. For single‐cell
applications, nanoCLAMPs have the potential for higher performance and lower cost than traditional
antibodies. Unlike traditional antibodies, binding events are straightforward to interpret because nanoCLAMPs
are monomers with a single target binding site and a single site for DNA‐labeling. nanoCLAMPs are also
economical to develop and use because they can be isolated without the need to immunize animals and can be
produced in bacteria at high levels. This work proposes 3 specific aims:
1. Generate a test set of 5‐10 nanoCLAMPs against cell surface proteins.
2. Optimize DNA labeling and cell‐binding conditions.
3. Compare the performance of nanoCLAMPs to traditional antibodies in single‐cell experiments and assessthe feasibility of scale‐up.
Successful completion of these aims will establish the feasibility of a technology platform with the potential to
accelerate the adoption of simultaneous single‐cell RNA and protein analyses.Studying cell populations often misses important variation among individual cells. The proposed work aims to
develop low cost, high precision tools that bind specific proteins and allow their measurement in single cells."

Successful deployment of environmentally friendly/energy-efficient technologies is limited by REE availability—negatively impacting national energy independence (a critical DOE concern), security, and the economy. This STTR project aims at commercializing a robust, environmentally-benign acid-free dissolution recycling (ADR) process that enables recovery of high-purity REEs from waste materials. It is the only technology known to the applicants that selectively/efficiently recovers REEs from wastes without limiting further recycling of the other waste components. During Phase I work, the ADR technology was demonstrated to be suitable for application in simple and complex types of e-waste containing REEs. Feedstocks included hard disc drives, drones, speakers, hand tools, electric vehicle motors, and cell phones. REEs were recovered from a complex waste stream containing two magnet compositions, showing the technology’s robustness. Hundreds of kilograms of feedstock materials were processed and rare-earth oxides with purity between 99.7 – 99.9% were recovered. A commercial partner has been identified who will use the recovered rare-earth oxide to produce metal. Afterward, the metal will be used to produce new permanent magnets. High-purity copper was also recovered as a byproduct of the recycling process. The Phase II goal is to establish the capacity to produce rare-earth oxide obtained via the ADR technology at a commercially profitable scale. A company that will purchase tons of the product has been identified, and more will be identified as the Phase II work is being completed. Hence, the ADR process will be commercialized for large-scale recovery of REEs from waste feedstock materials, byproducts of the scaled-up recycling technology will be valorized, and techno- economic analyses will be performed to guide the commercialization strategy. Consequently, process adjustments necessary for a more-profitable commercialization will be applied. Of the >15.25 billion pounds of e-waste generated in the U.S. in 2019, ~13 billion pounds remain unrecovered, and the lack of robust technology limited REE recovery for re-use from the 15% that was recovered. Commercializing the ADR process will greatly reduce these environmental pollutants while recovering high-value materials critical for U.S. technology manufacturing, the economy, and national security."

of cancer in the U.S., with over 80,000 new cases expected in 2019. For early-stage carcinomas, patients
receive intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy, or transurethral resection of the bladder
tumor (TURBT) with intravesical chemotherapy. Both are associated with a high rate of recurrence and
eventual progression. BCG fails many patients who are immunocompromised or who experience adverse
reactions, while TURBT with chemotherapy fails because the chemotherapeutic agent is not sufficiently
retained in the bladder to penetrate lesions that aren’t resected. Thus, there is a need for an improved drug
formulation for early-stage (CIS, Ta, T1, T2) TCC capable of 1) penetrating the tumor beyond the superficial
cell layers, and 2) increasing the dwell/contact time between the chemotherapeutic agent and the cancer cells.
To that end, NanoMedTrix (NMTx) has developed a particle based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN)
that carries known chemotherapeutic agents and is designed to improve their specificity, dwell time, and tumor
penetration. Our Phase I SBIR project exceeded our goals and demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the MSN
particles in carrying and releasing epirubicin in vivo in a murine TCC orthotopic model and in vitro using cultured
human TCC cells. Through our participation in the NIH I-CORPS program we spoke with key opinion leaders
(urologic oncologists) in the clinical bladder cancer space. As a result, we are completing our Phase I work using
the MSN to deliver clinically relevant doses of gemcitabine, docetaxel, and mitomycin-c in the same model.
Following our Phase I success, our Phase II SBIR is designed to complete the acquisition of data required by
the FDA for initiation of IND approval of NMTx MSN in human clinical trials. Specific Aim 1 describes the
necessary in vitro tasks: optimizing particle chemistry and validating our larger canine model using cultured cells
and canine TCC organoids. Specific Aim 2 describes completion of murine orthotopic studies and the start of
pre-clinical trials in dogs with spontaneously occurring TCC. Specific Aim 3 lays out our plan for carrying out
cGMP synthesis, packaging, and analysis of our IND.
Beyond setting the stage for FDA IND approval and first-in-human clinical trials, Phase II completion will
strengthen our position with investors/partners in the pharmaceutical industry, with whom we will partner in SBIR
Phase IIB, Phase III and beyond to expand clinical trials and ultimately commercialize the technology. We are
continuing to work with the urology contacts we made in I-CORPS who are eager to participate in clinical trials,
and we have received interest from Pharma companies (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Urovant, and others). Our
proprietary technology will provide licensees with improved performance from established chemotherapeutics
that have already gone off-patent, thus making our technology attractive both clinically and commercially.
Ultimate commercial success of this SBIR work will greatly benefit human health while reducing medical costs."

The proposed test will facilitate population-wide screening for prior exposure, giving epidemiologists and policy-makers insight into the virus's spread and the frequency of asymptomatic cases. Individuals will understand their levels of risk (e.g., someone with strong immunity may be protected from re-infection in the near-term) to make informed decisions. The proposed technology will be a quantitative test, which may allow immunity level to be correlated with disease severity or other parameters. The proposed test can be adapted easily to query multiple antigens simultaneously to address more complex medical assessments. Beyond the current pandemic, this flexible technology will be useful for exposure testing for diverse pathogens and immunogens in applications ranging from epidemiology to vaccine development. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores a novel method for ultra-high throughput serology testing. Briefly, high density arrays of patient samples will be queried with fluorescently labeled COVID-19 antigens to identify patients with antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For the proposed project: Sample preparation and arraying (printing) techniques and workflows will be optimized. Assay probes (Covid-19 antigens) and conditions will be optimized using spiked samples and commercially purchased sera from patients, purchased commercially and deidentified. The assay's sensitivity and specificity will be measured using anti-COVID (50 samples) and non-reactive (100 samples) sera. Finally, given that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is related to other coronaviruses––some of which regularly circulate in humans, the potential for assay probes to cross-react with antibodies raised against previous (i.e., non-COVID) infections will be determined. The results of the proposed work will provide proof-of-concept for massively parallel, population-level serology screening.

leading cause of cancer-related death. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) makes up greater than 90%
of all pancreatic cancer diagnoses and has an overall five-year survival rate of just 10%. New therapeutic options
are needed to improve the poor prognosis for patients with PDAC. External beam radiation therapy is a staple
in the current treatment of PDAC, but its clinical therapeutic efficacy is limited by unavoidable dose-limiting
toxicities to normal tissues and its inability to target metastatic disease. The development of low-molecular-
weight targeted radionuclide therapeutics (TRTs) is an attractive alternative to external beam radiation therapy
due to their reduced non-target toxicity and systemic targeting capabilities. However, the short residence time of
TRTs in tumors due to clearance greatly reduces deliverable radiation doses and inhibits clinical translation. The
Garrison laboratory at the University of Nebraska Medical Center has developed a novel endolysosomal trapping
approach to substantially increase tumor residualization and radiation dose delivery of receptor-targeted agents.
The neurotensin receptor subtype I (NTSR1) has been shown to be overexpressed in PDAC biopsies and has
been validated in the clinic. Using this trapping approach, the long-term goal of this project is for AdductNE, LLC
to develop an NTSR1-targeted TRT with high therapeutic efficacy for PDAC to improve clinical outcomes.
During this Phase I project, AdductNE, LLC will optimize the structure of the TRT to further enhance the tumor-
to-kidney (T/K) radiation dose ratios (Specific Aim 1) and provide proof-of-concept of its therapeutic efficacy and
safety in PDAC models (Specific Aim 2). In Specific Aim 1, the TRT construct will be altered to increase NTSR1-
positive tumor residualization and reduce/block renal uptake resulting in an increase in T/K ratios. In vitro
characterization of the TRT will be carried out to examine stability, protease inhibition, NTSR1 affinity and adduct
formation efficacy. In vivo tumor targeting and retention efficacy, tumor-to-non-target ratios and human dosimetry
estimates will be determined in PDAC xenograft models. For Specific Aim 2, the maximum tolerated dose,
therapeutic efficacy and safety of the TRT will be established. Histopathological and blood analysis/monitoring
will be carried out to measure radiotoxicity in tumor and normal tissues. In Phase II, AdductNE, LLC will validate
the TRT in more advanced PDAC models and in conjunction with current chemotherapeutic regimens. The
necessary toxicity and manufacturing scale-up studies will also be performed for the submission of an
Investigational New Drug (IND)-approval. In 2018, the market value estimate for pancreatic cancer treatment
was $1.9 billion but is expected to grow to $4.7 billion by 2026. Our commercialization strategy is to develop,
validate and de-risk our drug as we progress towards first-in-human studies. AdductNE, LLC will partner, through
licensure or acquisition, with larger pharmaceutical companies to help support and guide clinical translation.Relevance: In this STTR grant, AdductNE, LLC plans to develop a targeted radionuclide therapeutic (TRT) to
improve the clinical outcomes for patients suffering from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The
developed TRT utilizes a technology that is expected to deliver substantially higher therapeutic efficacy relative
to what can currently be achieved in the clinic."

This project will support the development and commercialization of a web-based technology to support traffic managers in cities and municipalities to better manage traffic using artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics. In addition to improving traffic flow and reducing congestion, the system will also significantly reduce harmful emissions, leading to more environmentally friendly city streets. The serviceable markets for this technology in the US and Europe, which together constitute 60% of the global signal-timing market, represent a $2.4 billion opportunity. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to develop a proof-of-concept for a fully adaptive traffic signal retiming solution that can robustly handle multiple signal corridors for commercialization. The key intellectual merit of this effort will be developing deep learning models that can run at scale and handle sensor noise robustly. The reinforcement learning process will help the system to adapt to changing traffic scenarios at different scales without the need for manual interventions. Research objectives that must be overcome in Phase II are focused on: 1) scaling the solution; 2) making the solution robust; and 3) ensuring that the system is user ready. Achieving these objectives may help ensure the product can successfully run on big-data architecture economically deployed on the cloud. The solution will also provide a deeper understanding of human-machine interaction.

water problems. This leads to at least 16 million cases of acute gastroenteritis directly linked to pollution at
community water systems, with tens of millions more directly impacted by chemical and organic pollutants.
Impacts are further exacerbated in locations dealing with water scarcity, in under-served populations, and
within other vulnerable populations already suffering from health disparities. Many of these water problems are
the direct result of managerial negligence, inconsistent monitoring, and a lack of the ability to anticipate where
problems may arise next. While the reasons for drinking water problems are complex, if we could anticipate
where health-based drinking water problems were to occur in the future, it could have an immediate
and positive impact on tens of millions of Americans annually. Interestingly, extensive data about water
quality and the performance of municipal water systems already exists in large, disparate databases. These
databases are largely ignored and, when used, are typically used only anecdotally and retroactively.
Preliminary evidence suggests that these existing databases, which contain histories of administrative
violations and sub-threshold water-quality results, can be mined to accurately predict future drinking water
crises. The Superior Statistical Research Randamp;D team is an internationally recognized group of water experts
with cross-cutting expertise in statistics/data analysis/modelling/computing, water-quality monitoring of
biological and chemical contaminants, and the ability to clearly and compellingly translate water-quality and
health information to actionable steps for individuals, organizations and communities. In this Phase I project,
we will show that it is possible to predict water-related, health-based problem areas utilizing already collected,
historical data on water quality and municipal water system performance. We will begin by harmonizing the
disparate water quality and municipal water system performance in two different states (Michigan and Iowa).
We will then utilize machine-learning techniques to predict health-based violation histories and will evaluate our
methods by comparing predicted violations to actual health-based violations in the previous 5 years. Finally,
we will identify at least 10 municipalities determined by our algorithm to be at the highest risk for future health-
based water problems and will do systematic sampling to confirm our model-based predictions. We will then
demonstrate how making these predictions can be leveraged to profitability by exploring how our model-based
predictions can be presented to customers in an economical, usable form. Proof of our concept and profitability
models in two states (Phase I) will set us up for widespread (multi-state) database harmonization and
improvement of the proposed machine-learning/modelling effort in Phase II. With multi-state harmonized
datasets, identification of key data gaps in particular states/areas, and proven financial models, our technology
will ultimately lead to dramatic reductions in the number of health-based drinking water problems annually.Project Narrative
Up to 45 million people per year in the U.S. are directly impacted by health-based drinking water problems, but
predicting where and when these health-based drinking water problems will occur remains a large and
complex obstacle. Current approaches focus on a reactive approach to health-based water-quality violations in
community water systems, rather than a proactive one that seeks to anticipate where problems will occur in the
future. The overall goal of this project is to leverage large and disparate historical datasets of water quality to
accurately predict locations of future health-based water-quality violations, validate the predictions, and
commercialize our proprietary predictions as a practical and cost-saving approach to anticipating and heading
off future health-based water problems."

In addition, groups involved in AAM have noted the need for being able to inform legacy users of the airspace (i.e., legacy manned aviation) of unmanned air traffic operating in their vicinity. KalScott has developed and tested a prototype of a such device that alerts pilots of unmanned operations in their vicinity, using legacy VHF airband voice comms (118-136Mhz).These messages can be readily heard by local air traffic and controllers using current (legacy) VHF airband communication radios, thus enhancing the overall safety of the system. nbsp;Under this proposed SBIR, we will complete the development of the device to meet all the emerging RemoteID, UTM and AAM specifications, conduct FCC and FAA certifications via ground and flight tests, and ready the device for serial production. In Phase I, the final technical changes will be implemented and detailed tests will be conducted. In Phase II detailed ground and flight tests to support certification will be conducted, and a robust, verifiable and certifiable supply chain and manufacturing process will be created. For this project, KalScott has assembled a team that includes a reputed avionics design firm, and discussions are underway with a leader in the cellular communications industry for marketing the device."

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to address a major issue in modern remote sensing, atmospherically induced noise in the data. EOS systems look through the atmosphere that distorts spectral relationships of reflectance (ratio of EOS-measured reflected light to the sunlight that would be received were there no atmosphere). The variable atmosphere distorts the data variably so must be corrected to accurately interpret highly useful measures such as agricultural production/yield, photosynthesis, plant water use, plant disease/insect infestations, etc., rendering EOS data unreliable unless corrected. The technical tasks are to: (1) study European Space Agency Sentinel 2 EOS data, (2) migrate the method to NASA/USGS Landsat 8, (3) adapt the method for calibration of the several decades-long Landsat Multispectral Scanner record that cannot otherwise be corrected to surface reflectance, (4) develop a calibration tool for multiple commercial EOS, and (5) develop a fully integrated software system.

Cold spray technology offers an effective solution to repair corrosion damage that can be applied at low temperature, therefore minimizing substrate heating, maintaining dimensional stability, and avoiding unwanted thermal effects (HAZ, thermal stresses, dilution layer formation, etc.). The repair will arrest crack growth, protect from further corrosion damage, and fully restore load carrying capacity of the component, and can be applied in-situ, eliminating the otherwise necessary component removal process. In Phase II, the project team selected structural materials and developed statistical material property data for future implementation efforts, evaluated surface preparation techniques and repair geometry effects, developed several advanced cold sprayed materials and testing methods, optimized the cold spray material through the development of high temperature stabilization techniques, designed, implemented and verified equipment modifications to enable in- situ repair within the LWR facility, and established working relationships with a LWR manufacturer, a DOE National Laboratory, and a large owner/operator, resulting in the identification of transition applications and demonstration of a cold spray repair on a LWR component. The phase IIA project will continue development of structural materials and transition cold spray by qualifying a repair in an in-situ application. VRC will work with our owner/operator contacts to develop in-situ cold spray repair, mockup demonstration, and code justification for cold spray in these applications. The team will develop novel material systems for LWR application, along with equipment augmentations and portable robotics for in-situ structural repair. This effort advances the state of the art in cold spray repair and develops the foundation for ASME code consideration, directly in line with the DOE’s need for in situ mitigation and repair of corrosion damage in LWR’s, offering owners/operators a cost-effective means of plant sustainment and reducing the overall maintenance burden of aging reactor components. This repair approach also improves the safety of LWR facilities, which provides both a benefit to the plant owner/operator, as well as the general public."

A 2012 Blue Ribbon Commission report to the Secretary of Energy states, .“..this nation’s failure to come to grips with the nuclear waste issue has already proved damaging and costly and it will be more damaging and more costly the longer it continues….” The proposed thermal salt sealing project provides a unique opportunity to develop a technology that can be used to isolate nuclear waste within a deep, impermeable underground salt formation. The knowledge acquired from this project has the potential to significantly contribute to the U.S. Department of Energy Used Fuel Disposition Campaign. Phase I produced promising results for the thermal salt seal concept. The project incorporated numerical modeling that indicated feasibility, achieved successful preliminary field tests in an underground mine, and recovered samples of the seal that were shown through permeability testing and microscopy to have features suitable for a permanent seal The overall goal of the Phase II effort is to continue to advance the thermal salt sealing application for nuclear waste disposal and conventional well plugging and abandonment, while building interest in the system from potential end-users and influencers. To achieve this goal, the Work Plan will focus on the following objectives: (1) enhanced analysis of Phase I field tests, (2) initial commercialization and market research, (3) commercial tool development, (4) numerical modeling, (5) prototype tool build, benchmark testing, and field-scale testing, (6) post-test analysis, and (7) commercialization and investment research. As an outcome of these tasks, we expect to provide the U.S. Department of Energy and private industry with a thermal salt sealing technology that can create an impermeable and impervious barrier of native salt. The primary commercialization opportunity for our technology will likely occur through well plugging and abandonment in the salt cavern industry. Several thousand underground salt caverns have been solution-mined throughout the world. As these caverns age, they eventually reach the end of their economic life and must be plugged and abandoned to ensure human safety and avoid environmental risk. However, a suitable long-term solution does not currently exist for plugging and abandoning salt cavern wells. By developing and deploying our proposed thermal salt sealing technology, we will provide a suitable plugging-and-abandonment solution for salt cavern wells and capitalize this opportunity, while also protecting the environment and human safety."

To delineate the extent of contamination, many of these sites are undergoing intensive site investigations and generating large quantities of investigation derived wastes (IDW). Current
disposal practices of landfilling or incineration are costly and burdensome. This proposal will develop an ex situ remedial treatment for PFAS and associated co-contaminants. Based on current research, we propose using electrocoagulation (EC) combined with chemical oxidation and electrochemically activated persulfate (EAP) to remove PFAS and associated co-contaminants. While we will focus on treating containerized wastes, we will also be evaluating these technologies as possible innovations to merge with AirLift’s patented groundwater modular delivery system. Thus, the ultimate goal is to fine tune the proposed EC and EAP technologies so that they can eventually be used in situ to treat PFAS-contaminated groundwater.AirLift’s current prototypes have the capacity to recycle and treat multiple pore volumes of IDW per day (20-27 times per day), are highly mobile and can be setup to treat soil or groundwater in numerous 55-gallon drums or larger roll-off dumpsters. Treatment costs are conservatively estimated to be 50% less than incineration."

Organic farmers in particular struggle to bridge the growing gap between supply and demand of organic products for several reasons â€” top among them being record-keeping chores. Small and mid-sized farmers face this issue more acutely as they transition to or work to stay certified organic. A recent study of 1800 farmers showed that ~40% report record-keeping as a key obstacle. Record-keeping and filing require- ments vary by the type/variety of crops and produce. Because a typical small or mid-sized farm owner grows multiple types of crops the record-keeping and filing tasks become onerous and often dissuade farmers from seeking organic certification. Big Data in a Box LLC (BDiB) pro- poses to develop validate and commercialize an easy-to-use portable device to capture and dig- itize the requisite data to make it efficient and affordable for these farmers to transition to or- ganic or to maintain certification. As envisioned the BDiB software will be provided via sub- scription along with cost-effective data-capture device. Phase I goals are to develop 1) a cost- effective and easy-to-use system that supports farmer-owner facility/certification compliance and 2) an innovative robust cost-effective portable edge-computing device that is network-inde- pendent. Testing will be carried out on local/regional farms for Phase I proof of concept. Commercialization Potential The current retail market for organic products was valued at $50 billion by the Organic Trade Association and is growing at >20%/yr. compared with 1% growth in the overall food sector. Reducing the barriers to record-keeping will facilitate growth in transitions and to stay organic thus meeting the growing demand. BDiB's Smart Portable Interactive Data Extraction and Re- porting (SPIDER) tool will help farmers reach this goal. Once we successfully test and validate our tool with participating farmers we propose to market the tool via a subscription service to small- and mid-sized farmers initially to the organic sector and later to all other farmers. Our market potential covers small- and mid-sized farms which constitute 94% of the 2.1 million farms nationwide. With a subscription pricing at $60 per year for the basic tool we hope to reach a significant portion of the market in five years or less. Because our tool is based on an edge- computing model the user has more autonomy with the data collection storage and use.

PROJECT SUMMARY
Hearing loss is a major health concern in our society, affecting over 360 million people
worldwide (World Health Organization, 2017). Cisplatin chemotherapy causes permanent
hearing loss in 40-60% of treated cancer patients. To date, no drugs have been approved by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for protection from cisplatin-, noise-, or age-related hearing
loss. Most candidate compounds currently in pre-clinical trials are related to antioxidants,
vitamins, and glutathione metabolism, and thus many of these compounds, such as sodium
thiosulfate, can interfere with cisplatin’s ability to kill the tumor cells.
We recently conducted unbiased high-throughput screens of bioactive compounds (total of
4,385 unique compounds) in a cochlear ear cell line and identified cyclin dependent kinase-2
(CDK2) as an important therapeutic target for cisplatin-induced cell death and hearing loss. In
the following focused screen of an additional 187 CDK2 inhibitors that have desirable drug-like
properties, we identified AZD5438 as the top hit, exhibiting an IC50 of 540 nM in the cochlear cell
line and an excellent IC50 of 5 nM ex vivo in mouse P3 cochlear explants treated with cisplatin.
AZD5438 was the most potent CDK2 inhibitor tested in our cochlear explant studies.
Furthermore, by local delivery of AZD5438 to adult FVB mice, the compound showed full
protection against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity as measured by Auditory Brainstem Response
(ABR) thresholds and cochlear histology. AZD5438 also protected against cisplatin induced hair
cell loss in vivo in zebrafish lateral line neuromasts at 100 nM.
Here we will evaluate the potential to repurpose the anti-cancer small molecule AZD5438, an
orally bioavailable CDK2 inhibitor that has already been found to be tolerated in healthy male
volunteers and solid-tumor patients in phase I and phase II clinical trials, for protection against
cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Our Specific Aim is to test whether AZD5438 protects from
cisplatin-induced hearing loss by systemic delivery in a mouse model. Our approach is to
administer AZD5438 by oral gavage to adult FVB mice treated with cisplatin, measure their ABR
thresholds and analyze their cochlear histology. The maximum non-toxic dose of oral AZD5438
will be experimentally determined and tested for hearing-protective effects. This work will shed
light on the possibility of using AZD5438 in an oral formulation to combat cisplatin-induced
hearing loss. In comparison to local delivery, oral delivery of an effective pharmaceutical product
has the advantage of patient convenience. In the future, we will also test the efficacy of oral
AZD5438 to protect from noise- and age- related hearing loss. If oral delivery of AZD5438
proves protective in this study, we will apply for IND-enabling SBIR phase II studies for cisplatin-
induced hearing loss in cancer patients.
As the main inventors for CDK2 inhibitors for hearing loss, both founders of Ting Therapeutics
LLC have already obtained the exclusive patent rights for AZD5438 and filed patent applications
in Europe, China, Japan and Hong Kong, and are negotiating for licensing the US patent rights.
Oral delivery of AZD5438, if successful, has the potential to be a significant step forward in
treating cancer patients against cisplatin-induced hearing loss.PROJECT NARRATIVE
The work in this proposal focuses on the development of an oral therapeutic small molecule
AZD5438 against cisplatin-induced hearing loss. If successful, this project will be a significant
step forward in the treatment of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in cancer patients."

PROJECT SUMMARYCisplatin is one of the most effective platinum-based compounds in the treatment of various types
of malignancies, including head and neck, ovarian, and lung cancer. Despite its efficacy, ototoxcity,
neurotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity stand out as the top three dose-limiting side effects of cisplatin
chemotherapy.Ototoxicity refers to drug or chemical-related damage to the inner ear sensory cells and neurons,
resulting in permanent, irreversible hearing loss. Elevation of hearing thresholds have been reported
in the majority of patients treated with cisplatin. To date, there are no FDA-approved drugs for the
treatment of cisplatin-induced hearing loss.This study aims to prevent cisplatin-induced damage to the inner ear cells by investigating drug
candidates which activate multiple pathways involved in mechanisms of cisplatin resistance. Using
recent advances in developing bioinformatic web-based tools that integrate genomic portraits and
compound activities, we have identified 6 FDA-approved candidate drugs that could be associated
with a cisplatin-resistant phenotype. The 6 final top drugs were selected based on their FDA-approval
and ability to grant at least 40% protection in either cellular or zebrafish models. The drug providing
the highest protection in cell culture, zebrafish and cochlear explant models has also been shown to
have synergistic effects on cisplatin in cancer cells and can cross the blood-brain-barrier. Therefore,
the combination of its protective nature in cochlear cells and destructive nature in cancer cells makes
it a viable option as a drug for cisplatin resistance for the inner ear.The results of this study will provide the key proof of principle to develop novel therapeutic
strategies against side effects of cisplatin chemotherapy. Moreover, our studies will provide
mechanisms of action of cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Repurposing this FDA-approved drug for new
function against the side-effects of cisplatin chemotherapy will significantly expedite the FDA approval
process and reduce its cost.PROJECT NARRATIVE
The work in this proposal focuses on repurposing an FDA approved drug for preventing cisplatin-induced
hearing loss. If successful, this project will be a significant step forward in the treatment of cisplatin-induced
hearing loss in cancer patients."

The goal of this Phase I SBIR is to develop a new platform that increases the stability and activity lifetime of
oxidase enzymes used in amperometric biosensor fabrication. This platform is based upon Design-Zyme’s new,
patent-pending approach for in vitro glycosylation of proteins and enzymes. This Phase I proposal consists of
two specific aims designed to (1) demonstrate that Design-Zyme’s novel platform can be leveraged to enhance
and improve the stability and activity lifetime of many, if not all, oxidase enzymes, and (2) to immediately
commercialize three improved enzymes for use by university, governmental, and industrial entities. Our
approach will be extended in Phase II to other protein families potentially useful in sensing applications, e.g.
dehydrogenase enzymes.
The field of biosensors has developed into a practical, cost-effective, and portable screening modality with
proven animal and human applications in health monitoring, disease diagnosis, drug development, food safety,
and point-of-care diagnostics. Our enhanced enzymes will enable the development of biosensors that have
been heretofore unavailable, which is expected to positively impact the development and manufacturing of
devices for new sensing applications. These new devices, based on the enzyme system(s) developed here, will
also provide a new paradigm for the clinical monitoring of glucose tolerance, blood-lactate monitoring, and other
disease states relevant to integrative medicine and ultimately, human health. These enhanced enzymes, and
the underlying platform, are a necessary first step to the development of continuous in vivo analyte monitoring
lasting months or years with little outside intervention.
This proposal is based on our significant preliminary results showing that in vitro glycosylation does not
compromise enzyme activity, but instead can enhance an enzyme’s initial activity and lifetime. This is in contrast
to most existing methods of glycosylation. We have found that hyaluronic acid, when covalently attached to an
oxidase, can improve its activity lifetime in solution and provide extended protection at elevated temperatures.
The stabilized enzymes that are a product of this Phase I can find utility in any monitoring device that presently
uses oxidase enzymes. This includes amperometric biosensors, wearable patches and other measurement
modalities. At the end of the Phase II SBIR, we will have a fully optimized platform that can optimize any oxidase
enzyme for use in in vivo (human and animal) biosensors.Project Narrative
There is a need for long-term health monitoring, disease diagnosis, drug development, and food
safety. Practical, cost-effective, and portable screening of compounds important for animal and
human health are of great importance. Our enhanced enzymes will aid in the clinical monitoring
of glucose tolerance, blood-lactate monitoring, and other disease states relevant to integrative
medicine and ultimately, human health."

during 2017 is over 5 million in the U.S. alone. The significant increase of opioids use disorder (OUD) cases
during the last 2 decades may be partially attributed to our overreliance on the prescription of the opioids for the
management of non-cancer chronic pain, such as osteoarthritis (OA) pain. The extensive use of opioids for pain
management can be associated with a variety of side effects including constipation, nausea, dizziness, vomiting,
liver damage, respiratory depression leading to brain damage due to the hypoxia, and physical dependence,
tolerance and addiction. The higher dose prescription because of the physical dependence and tolerance
leading to OUD and the intertwined heroin use related with the addiction have been reported. Therefore, the
goals of the project are to develop, translate and commercialize a novel non-opioid therapy for sustained,
effective, safe management of OA pain, and to prevent opioids use disorder among osteoarthritis patients.Through an innovative structural design, we have developed a N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA)
copolymer-dexamethasone (Dex) prodrug (P-Dex-H) that is a free-flowing aqueous solution at reduced
temperature, but becomes a hydrogel (ProGel) when the temperature is raised to andgt; 30 °C. This
thermoresponsive phase transition property allows the macromolecular prodrug formulation to be deposited in
the synovial cavity with sustained presence for a protracted period of time. With continuous exposure to the
synovial fluid, we have shown that the ProGel can then gradually solubilize and release after which it is
internalized by synovial phagocytic cells and activated subcellularly to release Dex. In the preliminary studies,
we have found that the P-Dex-H-based ProGel was able to provide sustained (andgt; 1 month) amelioration to the
joint pain models of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA), monoarticular adjuvant-induced arthritis (MAA) and
monoiodoacetate-induced osteoarthritis (MIA). Furthermore, typical glucocorticoid side effects, such as
osteopenia, adrenal gland atrophy were not associated with ProGel treatment. Injection site reactions (e.g.,
arthralgia), as seen in the case of Flexion Therapeutics’ Zilretta™ (triamcinolone acetonide extended-release
formulation) was also absent in animals treated with ProGel. However, ProGel formulations have not been
evaluated in a clinically relevant osteoarthritis model such as the surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus
(DMM) mouse model. Therefore, in the Phase I of this fast-track project, we propose to test the feasibility of
using ProGel to treat arthritis pain in the DMM mouse model. A thorough physicochemical characterization,
including the construction of the phase diagram for ProGel will also completed in preparation for the optimization
of the formulation. For Phase II, we proposed to optimize the ProGel formulation by adjusting a variety of
structural parameters with the goal of identifying an optimized formulation with the most potent and sustained
joint pain amelioration and minimal toxicity. The IND enabling PK/BD study of this optimized ProGel formulation
will then be performed. The successful completion of the proposed research will help the ProGel technology to
become IND ready for further clinical evaluation.NARRATIVEOsteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder, affecting over 25 million individuals in the U.S.
Currently, there are no approved therapies that have been shown to alter the natural progression of OA joint
pathology. Effective control of OA pain therefore remains the primary therapeutic objective. Opioids have been
widely used for the treatment of OA joint pain. Given the chronic and progressive nature of OA, long-term use
of opioids carries an increased risk of substance dependence and abuse. In light of the current opioid epidemic,
there is an urgent need for more effective non-opioid analgesics for OA pain management. This proposal seeks
to further develop, translate and commercialize a novel macromolecular dexamethasone prodrug-based
thermoresponsive hydrogel (ProGel) as a novel intra-articular injection formulation for better clinical management
of OA pain."

The goal of this Phase I SBIR is to develop a new platform that enables dehydrogenases to be used as enzymes
in amperometric biosensors. Regardless of the platform or measurement modality, all biosensor designs require
the use of an enzyme to properly function. Biosensors are devices that measure compounds important for
human health. FDA approval has already been achieved for amperometric biosensors that monitor glucose in
humans, and several new biosensor platforms are currently under development. Biosensors require an enzyme
that is specific for the compound to be measured.
This proposal will showcase our platform’s utility by developing an enzyme system that provides the ability to
monitor cortisol in point-of-care devices and biosensors. The major impediment to the development of a
continuous cortisol monitoring system is the lack of an enzyme that can be used as part of device fabrication.
At this time, no enzyme suitable for cortisol detection and suitable for biosensing applications has been described
or commercialized. This illustrates the importance of developing new enzyme systems specific for analytes
important in human health. Once proof-of-concept is demonstrated in Phase I, our Phase II will extend the
platform for use with other dehydrogenases to monitor analytes important in human health and disease. Phase
II targets include maleate dehydrogenase, GABA dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, pyruvate
dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase. These dehydrogenase enzymes
either have no known oxidase counterpart or have oxidase counterparts that are so unstable as to render the
enzyme essentially useless in biosensor fabrication for studies in freely moving animals. At the end of the Phase
II SBIR, we will have an optimized platform that produces highly stabilized dehydrogenase enzymes for use in
biosensors. In addition, a functioning cortisol biosensor suitable for use in humans will be developed. No
diagnostic device presently exists to continuously measure cortisol level in vivo.
In this study we will use our proposed platform to create a cortisol enzyme system by coupling together two novel
enzymes to produce a signal that can be detected on an electrode with high sensitivity. This dual enzyme
approach that features a covalently attached co-enzyme molecule, is highly innovative and will enable, for the
first time, the continuous monitoring analytes important to human health such as cortisol. New devices based
on this technology will allow clinicians to monitor and manage pain, stress, and other conditions that negatively
impact human health. Our platform will positively impact the development and manufacturing of other devices
for novel sensing applications. The Phase I deliverable will be a prototype of the coupled enzyme system
demonstrating proof-of-concept for a selective, sensitive and efficient mechanism of monitoring cortisol levels in
tissues and fluids. The successful completion of this proposal is the necessary first step to establishing
a continuous method of monitoring cortisol in all at risk individuals.Project Narrative
Biosensors are the most effective platform to continuously measure analytes known to be
important for human health. Cortisol is a stress hormone that is unambiguously recognized as
important in human health, and no method exists to continuously measure cortisol. Continuous
and real-time, long-term studies of in vivo cortisol levels will enable clinicians to monitor and
manage pain, stress, and other conditions that negatively impact human health."

Our Specific Aim is to test whether this natural compound protects from aminoglycoside-induced
hearing loss by systemic delivery in a mouse model. Our approach is to intraperitoneally administer
the compound for 15 days in adult C57BL/6 mice treated with kanamycin, measure their ABR and

The goal/objective of the above activities is to develop an ACSIE that will reduce considerably the number and size of internal cooling fans while improving the cooling performance, energy savings and reliability within the current cabinet footprint. Thermal management of the computers and servers are increasingly becoming crucial as powerful microprocessors shrink in size and their cooling needs rise. Current shipboard computer racks/cabinets use a series of rigidly mounted fans that require ducts directly connected to the ships HVAC system. These systems are effective and efficient only to a point and lack the scalability to deal with the fast-increasing thermal loads of the current and future server systems. PEI is proposing ASCIE cabinets that are cost-effective, reliable and provide better thermal performance through a variety of innovative materials and technologies. These cabinets will employ cooling strategies that will be quieter in operation, more efficient in regulating internal temperature conditions, and adaptable to future systems."

This Composite Expandable Shelter will meet the Army’s Future Command Post requirements, supportive of the mobility needs of the U.S. Army while improving the emplacement, erect/strike cycle time of a 1-side expandable Vehicle Mounted Expandable Command Post (VMECoP). The Army’s new command post computing environment (CPCE) is a web-enabled command post system, an upgraded platform which improves the service’s data base collaboration. The legacy system required soldiers to frequently move between multiple computers to complete mission tasks. The CPCE consolidated the functionality of four field platforms: (1) the command post of the future, (2) the tactical ground reporting system, (3) the command web and (4) the global command-and-control system. The consolidation of these platforms improves communication among troops, with the ability to drop graphics into maps, share documents or chat with soldiers in the field, allowing for increased speed of decision making resulting in increased force lethality. The CPCE greatly increases the speed of battle dictating the Command Post be more mobile than the current DoD Standard of Family of Tactical Shelters offers. PEI’s conceptual composite expandable shelter will apply advanced fibers, resins, and manufacturing processes to reduce the weight of the shelter to achieve greater mobility and reduce emplacement cycle time. PEI will model alternative automated erect/strike techniques to assess the speed and reliability of the mechanisms to meet the Expansion Time and Time to Mobility Objectives. Upon short notice the PEI Composite Command Post will have improved mobility such that this mission critical command capability can be transported and emplaced to increase CPCE up-time with a resultant increase in the lethality of the force.0"

The goal is to minimize the lengthy and expensive clinical trials that ultimately fail because of their failure to enter the BBB by providing a high assurance that the drug can pass the blood/brain barrier (BBB). The project will facilitate discovering next-generation interventional treatments for serious brain-related diseases and will greatly benefit patients and families fighting debilitating diseases that are difficult or impossible to treat with current methods. The ability to screen for BBB penetration early is needed. An estimated 2% of small drug molecules and no large molecules are able to pass into CNS to treat neurodegenerative diseases, multiple sclerosis and strokes, accounting for 12% of total global deaths. Each of these diseases represents a major healthcare cost and caregiver burden. The proposed project focuses on mimicking the BBB. This work will utilize cylindrical hydrogels to provide three distinct regions for the growth of multiple types of cells related to the BBB, thereby providing an environment that is similar to the native system. This will provide a highly relevant model to visualize the active transport of bioactive molecules across the BBB to create effective, next-generation therapeutics for use in the CNS. One goal is to show cell survival throughout ten-day-long trials. Additionally, the genetic response of the cells within the system will be analyzed to better understand their behavior, and the system’s inherent conductivity will show real-time cell-to-cell communication. Once a model is created, the transport of caffeine across the model barrier will be studied and compared with known values of how the molecule acts within the body to begin validating the system. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Other solutions such as metallic nanoparticles are also not ideal as they are heavy and may promote galvanic corrosion. A conductive coating may eliminate the need for an embedded mesh. This coating would be applied by common painting techniques such as high-pressure low volume (hplv) systems and others as required by the customer. This system will be easy to apply, maintain, and repair when necessary. Electrical conductivity in aircraft coatings is required for a safe, efficient, lightweight aircraft. Aircraft coatings emphasize longevity, but do not attempt to improve its ability to conduct electricity. Our unique method allows us to create an optimal solution to improve the conductivity of aircraft coatings, resulting in a substantial increase in safety, performance, corrosion resistance and longevity. The notable result is a coating that will prevent electrical charge from building up on the surface of an aircraft"

We will eliminate the need for a separate coating, by producing an electrically conductive rain erosion resistant coating through the addition of well dispersed carbon nanotubes.  Therefore, no special mixing step would be required by the airmen.   Our lab tests demonstrate that the production of an electrically conductive rain erosion resistant coating is feasible. As previously mentioned, electrically insulating aircraft coatings increase the likelihood of dangerous charge buildup due to static electricity accumulation and do not protect from lightning strikes.  The current solution is a separate conductive coating which is applied to key surfaces.  Aircraft conductive coating systems in use today are very difficult to mix and apply.  A key part of our innovation and intellectual property that makes this technology possible is that of the introduction of both carbon nanotubes and hydrogen bonding.  The innovators have developed a technique to utilize functionalized carbon nanotubes in order to maximize their interactions with the base fluids that form the cured coatings.  The hydrogen bonding creates a pathway that increases electrical conductivity of the bulk material.  Normally it is very difficult to take advantage of the superior properties of individual carbon nanotubes as the junctions/gap between tubes is often so large that it creates a barrier that defeats the many advantages of carbon nanotubes.  The addition of functional groups such as hydroxyl groups can bridge this gap between tubes and overcome this gap/barrier.  It also allows for a bonding with the solvents and base fluids.  Once cured the coating will retain these bridges.  Further, once we have dispersed the functionalized nanotubes in the coating base fluids, it is a stable solution that can be applied to the customers aircraft through their preferred methods. Our Air Force customer would prefer to eliminate the additional conductive coating by using a conductive rain erosion resistant coating.  The  erosion resistant coating as purchased will produce an insulating coating and therefore must be modified to meet the expectations and requirements of the customer. Further development of these coatings will produce a product and process that will better satisfy the customer. "

One of the more recent goals of cochlear implant (CI) surgery is the preservation
of residual hearing to improve overall patient outcomes. Unfortunately, up to 50% of patients experience
delayed residual hearing loss following cochlear implant surgery, resulting in a diminished quality of life. To
address this issue, iotaMotion is developing an insertion system to assist surgeons in performing controlled
and consistent CI electrode insertions as well as to monitor the electrocochleography (ECochG) readings taken
from the cochlea during CI electrode insertion, which have been shown to indicate cellular damage and
residual hearing loss. The system controls the rate of electrode array insertion and responds in real time to
ECochG feedback received from the cochlear tissues via a feedback loop. In Phase I, a working benchtop
prototype was developed and the system response to ECochG signals was demonstrated in both benchtop
and large animal in vivo proof-of-concept studies. Control algorithms were also developed as part of the
feedback loop to the insertion system’s motor unit. Continuing with these results, the goals of this proposed
Phase II SBIR project are to: 1) Improve System Usability and Enhance Use Features. With the goal of
continuing to improve the prototype developed in Phase I, Aim 1 work will improve system fidelity, incorporate
real-time impedance checks, integrate the system into an easy-to-use tablet for use in the OR, and evaluate
usability. 2) Establish Manufacturing and Quality Controls. The supply chain and manufacturing and quality
procedures to verify/validate system safety and reliability will be implemented using relevant standards and
FDA guidance to define testing procedures. The electrical safety, sterility, biocompatibility, functionality, and
data security testing of production-level devices that will be used for pre-clinical studies and commercialization
will be performed. 3) Evaluate In Vivo Efficacy of the Combined System. The system will be evaluated in an
acute in vivo model of cochlear implantation. By comparing usage of the system to the current gold standard of
manual CI electrode insertions, iotaMotion will evaluate the system’s ability to monitor ECochG signals from
the cochlea and will confirm that the system induces no increases in scalar translocations or OSL fractures
when compared to manual insertions as assessed by 3D X-ray microscopy. 4) Perform Observational
Clinical Study. As part of the regulatory strategy, the ability of the ECochG monitoring system to collect
reliable and significant ECochG signals in an observational clinical study will be evaluated. Completion of these
Phase II Aims will set the stage for the development and production of the system in a GMP environment and
execution of a prospective clinical trial designed to establish safety and efficacy in humans. We envision the
data collected to comprise the basis for the Device History Record that will be used to prepare for first-in-man
studies. This Phase II funding will help secure additional company investment and will move us much closer to
commercializing this much-needed treatment for people suffering from disabling hearing loss.Project Narrative
Despite the many advances in cochlear implant technology, recent clinical trials have found that up to 50% of
patients who undergo “hearing preservation” cochlear implant surgery can experience continued hearing
decline after surgery—likely due to intracochlear trauma experienced during electrode insertion. To address
this issue, iotaMotion has developed an insertion tool that couples cochlear implant ECochG
measurements to a micromechanical control system to aid the surgeon in sensing, predicting, and
mitigating insertion trauma during an electrode insertion. This SBIR Phase II project will allow major
further advances to be made with this novel tool that, when commercialized, will significantly reduce the
incidence of residual hearing loss for the millions who are candidates for receiving cochlear implants."

19-001. CET has proposed a direct Phase II SBIR application to create more reproducible
human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and create methods for growing, maintaining,
and authenticating iPSCs. A major challenge in iPSC manufacturing and subsequent
differentiation is the emergence of genetic instability that result from non-random chromosomal
mutations. Genetic instability results in clonal expansion of genetic variants that increases
iPSC heterogeneity. The experimental variables that promote genetic instability are not well
understood. Yet, oncogene-dependent reprogramming and prolong cell culturing are clearly
linked to genetic instability. Moreover, prior iPSC reprogramming methods adapted for
preclinical research have not been optimized to mitigate against the infectious, inflammatory,
neoplastic and genetic risks for cell therapy. Thus, iPSC reprogramming should be
standardized to include non-integrating, virus-free and oncogene-free methods, which would
offer reproducible iPSC in adherent and suspension cells. This milestone would mitigate
oncogenic and viral effects that could reduce genetic instability in iPSC manufacturing and
differentiation. Further, iPSC reproducibility and differentiation would improve if growth factors
displayed fully human posttranslational modification (PTM). While bacterial-manufactured
growth factors and non-human glycosylated peptides and proteins are ubiquitous in the stem
cell field, they exhibit differential bioactivity than their native human counterparts. Thus, using
growth factors that lack a fully human PTM may amplify the genetic instability and distort cell
phenotype of iPSC and differentiated cells, particularly for multiple differentiation steps that
require multiple growth factors. CET is a biotechnology company with a diverse pipeline of
human somatic stem cells and a first-in-class non-integrating, feeder-free, virus-free and
oncogene-free iPSC reprogramming approach that has been validated and published for
adherent cells and suspension cells. Moreover, CET is the sole source manufacturer of select
postnatal stem cells. These capabilities allowed CET to obtain immortalized human postnatal
stem cells designed for biologic bioprocessing of fully human PTM. Thus, CET is poised to
develop iPSC and differentiated cells through manufacturing processes that mitigate genetic
instability. The focus of this proposal will be to develop a manufacturing platform to create GLP
and GMP-grade iPSC with the least amount of genetic instability even after subsequent
neuroprogenitor cell differentiation.Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) predominately serve as preclinical research tools
and offer potential regenerative medicines. Yet, there remains a significant need for
reproducible iPSC reprogramming that can equally serve preclinical drug discovery and cell
therapy. Prior iPSC reprogramming methods adapted for preclinical research have not been
optimized to mitigate against the infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic risks for cell therapy.
Thus, iPSC reprogramming should be standardized to include non-integrating, virus-free and
oncogene-free methods and have the diversity to reprogram both adherent cells and
suspension cells. This milestone would mitigate oncogenic and viral effects that could skew the
predictability of drug screening and offer greater safety for cell therapy and less genetic
instability. Further, there is a need to improve the reproducibility of iPSC reprogramming and
differentiation protocols by using fully human growth factors rather than the current use of
bacterial-based growth factors. The focus of this proposal will be to develop a platform to create
reproducible GLP and GMP-grade iPSC with an additional emphasis on neural differentiation.
The biotechnology will be coupled with rigorous computational analyses of the genetic
phenotypes of iPSC and neuroprogenitor cells."

Skeletal muscle atrophy diminishes the health and quality of life of tens of millions of people in the US alone.
Frequent causes of muscle atrophy (which often co-exist in the same patient) include aging, malnutrition,
muscle disuse, critical illness, certain medications, and a broad range of chronic illnesses including cancer,
heart failure, COPD, diabetes, renal failure, cirrhosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and HIV/AIDS. Frequent effects of
muscle atrophy include weakness, impaired activity, falls, prolonged hospitalization, delayed rehabilitation, loss
of independent living, and increased mortality. However, despite its broad clinical impact, skeletal muscle
atrophy lacks a pharmacologic therapy and thus represents an enormous unmet medical need. A major goal
of Emmyon, Inc. is to discover and develop a pharmaceutical for skeletal muscle atrophy. In our Phase
I SBIR project, we discovered and patented a confidential and proprietary small molecule compound (EMMY1-
06) that significantly increases strength and muscle mass and significantly reduces immobilization-induced
muscle atrophy. In addition, we found that EMMY1-06’s beneficial effects on skeletal muscle are accompanied
by striking reductions in fat mass, resulting in additional protection against obesity and obesity-related glucose
intolerance. In this Phase II SBIR proposal, we seek to continue this exciting work by advancing the
development of EMMY1-06 and related molecules as pharmaceuticals for skeletal muscle atrophy and
related metabolic disorders. Specifically, we will further investigate EMMY1-06andapos;s safety, efficacy, and
mechanisms of action in mouse models of skeletal muscle atrophy and diet-induced obesity and glucose
intolerance; together, these studies will significantly advance EMMY1-06 towards final development and
commercialization in SBIR Phase III. In parallel to our detailed studies of EMMY1-06, we will design,
synthesize and characterize novel compounds that are structurally related to EMMY1-06, seeking to identify
additional compounds with pharmacologic properties that are similar to or perhaps even better than those of
EMMY1-06. Together, these studies will rigorously advance the scientific understanding and commercial
development of a highly promising new class of pharmaceutical agents for skeletal muscle atrophy.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Skeletal muscle atrophy, also known as muscle wasting, is a widespread and serious condition that affects
tens of millions of people in the US alone. Unfortunately, right now, we do not have any medicines to help
prevent or treat skeletal muscle atrophy in patients. To help address this issue, we propose a Phase II SBIR
study to investigate and develop a new and promising class of potential medicines for skeletal muscle atrophy."

lifetime. Mental illnesses have an excessively large loading of Disability Adjusted Life Years, making early
intervention crucial for both individuals and society. Differentiating bipolar disorder (BD) from major depressive
disorder (MDD) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) can be especially challenging if clear
mania is absent. In fact, BD patients go an average of 6-10 years without the proper diagnosis, with 70%
misdiagnosed with MDD instead. The challenge of identifying BD patients among depressed individuals is
complex but critical because diagnosis determines treatment. The use of antidepressant (AD) medications in
patients with BD can lead to worsening of illness. We have recently shown that, using resting fMRI, we can
predict future medication class response with high accuracy (andgt; 90%). In this project we will build on this work to
generalize to a new MRI scanner and clinical assessment protocol. In addition we will develop, in consultation
with multiple psychiatrists, a cloud-based tool to analyze and report the results from the brain imaging protocol
and machine learning analysis, in a timely, meaningful, and interpretable manner. Results are expected to be an
important step forward in the eventual development of clinical useful markers of mental illness.

a patient will exit a chair in the near future. Specific Aims include: identifying video containing patient chair exits
from Ocuvera’s database of recorded three-dimensional patient video obtained from previous studies;
detecting and modeling chairs of various types; and designing new algorithms for predicting and detecting exits
from chairs. Results include reporting of simulations of algorithm performance using Ocuvera’s proprietary

Little is known about unattended patient chair exits in hospitals, particularly among older adults, including their
frequency, antecedent patient behaviors, or association with falls or injuries. The proposed project seeks to
collect this information as well as develop a novel intervention to mitigate falls associated with bedside chairs.
Reduced falls would lead to reduced healthcare costs and improved quality of life for patients."

This STTR Phase I project uses mixed-method formative evaluation strategies to develop, test, and evaluate an
alpha prototype of Breezmed, a point-of-care electronic prior authorization web-based platform. Prior
authorization burdens the current medical system, hampering a provider’s ability to efficiently prescribe
medication and in a timely fashion. This often leads to treatment non-compliance among patients and is
particularly onerous for mental illnesses, which often require rapid stabilization with prescription medication.
There is also evidence of high treatment non-compliance if medications are expensive or difficult to obtain.
Moreover, substantial empirical evidence reinforces high levels of provider burnout stemming from the tedium
required to obtain prior authorization from insurers. The lag between when the provider electronically transmits
the prescription to the pharmacy and when actual dispensing occurs burdens patients too, who routinely find out
their medication is not covered only after they have traveled to the pharmacy to obtain the medication. Recent
surveys of providers conducted by AMA and other healthcare advocacy organizations show a considerable loss
of workforce hours that could be prudently spent providing treatment, but is instead allocated to peer-to-peer
consultations or completing forms required for insurance approval. These manual processes consume precious
time and resources and detract from needed clinical practice time. Breezmed offers a software-as-a-solution
web-based platform that seamlessly and securely integrates with existing electronic health record systems. The
provider initiates Breezmed at the point-of-care drawing off diagnostic information, patient treatment history,
insurance authorization requirements and formulary rules to efficiently order medication. The platform offers
considerable economic and societal benefits and can securely piggyback to existing EHRs with minimal workflow
disruption. The proposed study involves three integrated arms including a consumer preference survey
administered to a nationally recruited panel of physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and
pharmacists. From this panel sample we further recruit focus group participants to explore in greater detail
barriers to prior authorization and probe computer-mediated solutions. We also utilize key informant interviews
with hospital administrators, healthcare technology experts in medical informatics, and insurers, and use this
detailed information to construct Breezmed’s wireframe architecture. We also conduct live usability tests with a
simulated EHR and test the Application Program Interface with the EPIC medical records system to ensure
smooth linkages in a secure HIPAA compliant environment. We have partnered with H4 technology, an Omaha-
based web application development company, and also the University of Nebraska Methodology and Evaluation
Research Core to conduct the formative evaluation components. The project benefits from an advisory board
with expertise in medical care and information technology, and a team of experienced faculty at UNMC to
shepherd timely execution of the grant.Project Narrative
The requirements of prior authorization for prescription medication can lead to physician burnout, loss
of quality time spent providing care, and patient treatment noncompliance. Solutions involve electronic
software-as-a-solution systems that piggyback to existing electronic medical record systems and
incorporate pharmacy formulary rules and insurance coverage. Breezmed addresses this specific need in
psychiatric and mental health care providing a cost-efficient means to request prior authorization at the
point-of-care including important diagnostic and patient medical history information to expedite
pharmacy dispensing medication without gaps in medical care. This project will incorporate consumer
preference information that can inform the development of a web-based application to expedite prior
authorization and test the application with simulated electronic medical record data."

The weakness of the amorphous silicon technology resides in the power conversion efficiency (watts per unit area), while the carbon fiber backed crystalline silicon cells lack field durability, flexibility and are bulky. The solution to this problem is to take the benefits of the two different technologies and combine them to produce a solar fabric that has high power conversion and ultra flexibility. This is accomplished by cutting down high efficiency solar cells and reassembling them into a series of interconnected solar cells in a tile like structure. This tile like structure resembles that of mosaic tile, a grid of 1cm x 1cm or 2cm x 2cm solar cells series and parallel connected. The tile like structure of solar cells is encapsulated with a very thin laminate and is bonded to a ultra-lite flexible fabric. This process creates a very light weight, high efficiency, ultra flexible solar module.

Antibody-mediated therapies are an attractive alternative to current smoking cessation strategies because
antibodies target the drug itself to prevent its crossing the blood brain barrier while exhibiting far fewer side
effects. To date, nicotine vaccines have met with limited success in clinical trials due to their low immunogenicity.
Like most subunit vaccines, they have historically suffered from poor efficacy due to their monomeric nature. Our
approach overcomes this limitation by using Hafion’s polyvalent adjuvant fusion technology (Haf) wherein
optimally sized hyaluronic acid (HA) is conjugated to a subunit vaccine to create a polyvalent HA-antigen
nanoparticle designed for uptake by dendritic cells and subsequent trafficking to germinal centers in the lymph
nodes to elicit maximum immunological memory. This proposal will bring together senior investigators from
Hafion LLC, Design-Zyme LLC, and the University of Kansas. Together, we will combine the recent successes
of a nicotine hapten, a self-adjuvating subunit antigen and the formation of nanoparticles to develop a nicotine
vaccine that provides long-term immunological memory. Our approach improves upon the current design of
nicotine vaccines by purposefully eliciting immunological memory to nicotine. To do this, Hafion is combining (1)
a customized nicotine hapten that will be (2) linked to our proprietary adjuvant + HA complex known to elicit
immunological memory (Design-Zyme LLC) by (3) the attachment of a carrier protein antigen that confers broad
protection against multiple Salmonella serotypes. The S. enterica carrier protein antigen is a subunit vaccine
developed by the Picking Laboratory. The goal of this SBIR is to create a safe, effective nicotine vaccine with
additional bacterial pathogen protection suitable for animal testing and eventual use in FDA clinical trials. This
project will demonstrate feasibility by assembling complete nicotine + Salmonella vaccine nanoparticles which
will then be tested for efficacy, antibody affinity and long-term immunogenicity against nicotine and Salmonella
in Phase I. Phase II of this proposal will involve studies to prepare the vaccine candidate for clinical trials as well
as address larger scale production using GLP and GMP practices.NARRATIVE
Tobacco use in the United States is responsible for up to one in five deaths annually (480,000 deaths/year) with
an estimated 50% of all regular smokers dying as a direct result of smoking. Recent figures published by the
American Cancer Society estimates, that in a span of only four years, smoking accounted for the loss of more
than 5 million years of combined potential life in men and women. The development of a vaccine against nicotine
would significantly improve smoking cessation success by introducing a potentially long-lasting, continuous and
cost-effective intervention providing assistance to individuals wanting to quit smoking."

Nanohybrids have recently emerged as a unique scheme for quantum photodetectors with distinctive advantages over their conventional semiconductor counterparts on: 1) the strong quantum confinement in quantum dots, enabling superior light absorption, spectra tunability, and reduced dark current due to suppressed phonon scattering; 2) exciton dissociation and charge transfer at the quantum dots/graphene interface build-in field for efficient photo-carrier generation; and 3) high photoconductive gain and external quantum efficiency proportional to the ratio between the carrier lifetime enhanced by the quantum confinement and the extremely short charge transit time due to the high mobility of graphene.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide and comes with a
significant economic burden associated with emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Oxidative stress-
mediated secondary injury post-TBI is a considerable risk factor for mortality and long-term impairment.
Immediately following TBI, a cascade of biological responses leads to increased production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), a critical mediator of the subsequent pathophysiological events that manifest through lipid
peroxidation (LPO), oxidation of proteins and DNA, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. While
technological and clinical advancements have improved the outcome for individuals suffering from TBI, there is
currently no effective neuroprotective therapy specific for the prevention and treatment of TBI-related secondary
injury associated with oxidative stress. Super antioxidants, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (Cat)
have the potential to attenuate the spread of inflammation and brain tissue damage if administered shortly after
a TBI. However, the activity of antioxidants is short-lived and rapidly cleared, limiting therapeutic strategies based
on exogenous delivery. ProTransit is developing an antioxidant-loaded nanoparticles (NP) delivery system, Pro-
NP™, for the treatment of TBI-related secondary injury, as (1) there is currently no effective neuroprotective
therapy specific for TBI-related secondary damage; (2) prior attempts have failed clinical translation due to
ineffectual drug delivery and retention, and unintended toxicity; and (3) super antioxidants like SOD and Cat are
effective but short-lived and rapidly cleared without a robust drug delivery system. The proposed research will
address and improve upon current approaches by providing a delivery system, Pro-NP™ that can (1) deliver
super antioxidants in a sustained manner, (2) rapidly accumulate and be retained in the damaged brain, and (3)
improve TBI recovery. Thus, this proposal will provide a therapeutic strategy for TBI-related secondary brain
damage, which is not available through current TBI treatment plans.In contrast with current secondary TBI therapeutic strategies, Protransit’s core patented nanotechnology,
Pro-NP™, can deliver biologically active antioxidant enzymes, like SOD and Cat, with sustained release and
increased target engagement with the site of injury. With increased accumulation and retention in a damaged
brain, antioxidant-loaded Pro-NP™, can exert a protective effect and prevent the spread of biochemical
derangements to surrounding healthy brain, potentially providing a significant advantage over other tested
therapies. Overall, this Phase I STTR project will determine the feasibility of SOD/Cat-loaded Pro-NP™ to inhibit
the development of secondary injury related to TBI. Further, this project will lay the foundation for a Phase II
STTR in which we will investigate the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and safety profile of Pro-NP™ for the
treatment of TBI.NARRATIVE

In the US over 7 millionAmericans drink water from community water systems (CWS) that contain nitrate (NO ) at3
concentrations exceeding the maximum contaminant level (MCL). The go-to technologies fornitrate treatment from CWSs produce highly concentrated nitrate brine residuals and are limitedby expensive brine disposal and management options. Further there exists more than 35 millionacres of sub-surface drained land in the US but no technology that removes nitrate fromagricultural drainage has established a significant market share. Based on the scale of nitratecontamination in community water systems and the growing need to reduce the nitrogen load fromtile-drainage the total addressable market for removal of nitrate has substantial potential. Onecomponent of our target market aloneâ€”the Point-of-Use Water Treatment Systems Marketâ€”isestimated to be worth $32.7 billion by 2023. Project Objectives: The main technical objective isto demonstrate/validate a highly efficient denitrification unit to treat agricultural return flow at acost lower than for incumbent technologies. In Phase I the team developed materials and systemswith superior nitrate removal and conversion efficiencies (>80%) when compared to Ion Exchange(IX) Reverse Osmosis (RO) and bioreactors. In Phase II downselected Phase I materials andsystems will undergo extensive optimization testing and operation in lab-scale and industrial-
scale prototypes to reach nitrate removal efficiencies exceeding 95% and stability exceeding 1000hours in accelerated testing conditions. To reach these objectives the team will synthesize novelcatalysts with tunable physical and chemical composition will develop novel spectroscopictechniques to investigate their corrosion mechanisms test them in reactors for lab scale andindustrial scale use and perform a full-fledged technoeconomic analysis to identify pathways forcommercialization.Anticipated Results and Potential Commercial ApplicationsAt the completion of Phase II development Pani Clean Inc will have constructed a smallengineering-scale nitrate treatment unit with nitrate conversion efficiencies exceeding 95%freshwater recovery percentages exceeding 95% no brine disposal issues and a cost of less than$1.20 per 1000 gallons of treated water. This is a four- to five-fold decrease compared toincumbent technologies. The 1706 community water systems (CWS) experiencing recentregulatory violations of nitrate levels primarily from agricultural practices represent theimmediate addressable market. The near-term applications will be to treat nitrates at the edge-of-
field environments and as Point-of-use (POU) nitrate treatment systems for individual residenceswith nitrate-contaminated private wells."

Improvements in neutron detectors for use at high-flux pulsed neutron sources are required for materials research involving neutron scattering experiments conducted at Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories, including single crystal diffractometers, neutron reflectometers, and time of flight (TOF) measurements. Generally, requirements for neutron detectors used in these facilities include spatial resolution on the order of 100 µm or less, neutron-detection efficiency exceeding 60% for 1-2 Å wavelength neutrons, ability to operate at rates exceeding 20 MHz with minimal dead-time, and gamma-ray rejection ratios of less than 1:106. Advances in sensor design, read-out technology, and data processing algorithms are required to meet these challenging requirements. These requirements will be met by integrating a piXelated Dual-Sided Microstructured Semiconductor Neutron Detector (DSMSND) with the Timepix3 read-out chip to create a detection assembly (the X-DSMSND) and software, capable of tiling into large imaging arrays. The objective of this project is to design, develop, fabricate, and test a neutron detector with very-high thermal-neutron detection efficiency and excellent spatial resolution, capable of operating in intense neutron fields. Previous researchers have shown that Timepix-based neutron detection is capable of sub-100 µm resolution via pixel interpolation. In the Phase I project, the DSMSND, which has demonstrated thermal-neutron detection efficiencies in excess of 69%, was redesigned to couple to the pixelated TimePix3 ASIC. The DSMSND presently consists of a conformal p-i-p junction read out with complicated bipolar electronics; for compatibility with a single pixel read-out chip, the revised pixelated DSMSND consists of a non-conformal p-i-n junction contact. Next, the frame-based Timepix read-out chip was replaced with the Timepix3, which offers a data- driven read-out for a maximum hit-rate of 80 MHz and provides both pixel-wise time-over-threshold (useful for direct imaging) and time-of-arrival (useful for TOF measurements) simultaneously, with the same spatial resolution as the Timepix, which is a 2-cm2 array of pixels with 55 µm pitch. Finally, simulations and models were revised and updated to accommodate the DSMSND geometry, sensor signal- formation characteristics, and demonstrate gamma-ray rejection-ratios on simulated data using energy and cluster-morphology discrimination. The product of Phase I is a prototype single-assembly detector with laboratory read-out electronics and software. In Phase II the team will focus on refinement of the X-DSMSND sensor design, perform pixel-wise energy calibration, demonstrate 2 x 2 tiling capability, develop more condensed readout, and mature associated software. Furthermore, the X-DSMSND hardware and software performance will be tested at the KSU TRIGA Mark II Nuclear Reactor Facility, and facilities such as the Los Alamos National Laboratory Neutron Science Center and the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The novel solid-state neutron detector array design will benefit a wide spectrum of applications beyond those of neutron scattering instruments. The scientific and commercial impact from the proposed research is expected to be significant, where the technology can meet the imaging demands of new generations of neutron scattering instruments. The neutron-imaging device has direct applications in many areas of science and engineering, such as high-resolution neutron radiography/tomography, neutron diffraction studies for stress/strain measurements in materials with internal defects, and surface diffraction studies of coatings."

Orbiting neutron spectrometer instruments are capable of measuring hydrogen within the top 10s of cms of regolith but are limited to spatial resolution in the 100rsquo;s of km^2. Reducing the spatial resolution of such an instrument via collimation is technically challenging. Alternatively, a neutron spectrometer instrument on a lunar rover would be able to measure hydrogen and He-3 within the top meter of regolith with a spatial resolution of ~1-m^2, similar to the cancelled RESOLVE mission. The RESOLVE rover was a large rover capable of prospecting for lunar ice, drilling into such ice, and determining the actual ice content. Thus, the area at which RESOLVE could prospect was hampered by the objectives of the other instruments. Therefore, this work aims to resurrect the prospecting part of the RESOLVE rover by allowing a small size and low cost of the micro-sized detector/rover package ldquo;the NeuRoverrdquo; that will allow for a single mission to disperse numerous micro-rovers over a much wider range than is possible with a single rover. The high-resolution data will be invaluable for future lunar exploration as it would allow future in-situ exploration to of highly concentrated locations of hydrogen. Additionally, such a mission could revolutionize our understanding of trapped volatiles on planetary bodies (e.g., Moon, Mercury, Ceres), as it will better map the heterogeneity vertically and laterally of hydrogen deposits. The innovation proposed is a small-mass, low-power, Neutron Energy Spectrometer (NES) for Mapping of Sub-Surface Lunar water content that can be supported by a micro-sized rover. The Team has previously developed an instrument that can measure the hydrogen content (water) of soil by stacking alternating layers of neutron absorber, moderator, and detectors.nbsp;"

Wildfires are increasing in number and severity, costing billions of dollars and resulting in thousands of lost homes and numerous deaths. Today, firefighters are unable to perform the backburns needed to contain wildfires without putting firefighters at risk. This project will result in technologies that directly address the critical pain points of firefighters by improving the intelligence and capabilities of drone systems. The research will develop algorithms for coordinating groups of robots, deep learning approaches and the development of novel datasets, algorithms that can predict fire activity and plan missions, and autonomous health monitoring approaches. This project will lead to safe, fast, affordable fire management. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable the development of the critical pieces of the technology that will transform fire management. More specifically, the proposed work focuses on the following key technical challenges and activities to incorporate intelligence into fire management: 1) Scaling to multiple drones intelligently operating in tandem and larger drones to cover complex, large terrain faster; 2) Transformation of pre- and post-fire mapping, currently a manual process taking more time than actual firefighting; 3) Creation of intelligent ignition planning and automated sensing capabilities that predict and take into account fire activity to increase safety and efficiency; and 4) Beta tests with customers to collect data for learning algorithms and to validate the research under field conditions. These challenges are especially difficult given the harsh fire environment, the weight and power constraints of commercial drones preferred for these activities, and the integration of two distinct domains, drone aerial navigation and fire management.

This project addresses these problems by proposing solar installations that operate synergistically with livestock production operations. These operations provide concentrated energy demand alongside land and structures that are conducive to solar photovoltaic power system installations. Furthermore, the shading and shelter provided by the solar installation improves animal production efficiencies and health. In Phase I of this project, we developed solar panel mounting hardware that integrates with pre-existing cattle fence posts and feed bunks and can withstand the rugged conditions associated with year-round use on a cattle feedlot. This system allows producers to offset their high electricity costs with solar power while synergistically providing shade and shelter for their cattle. In Phase II, we will expand rural installation opportunities via our hardware and create a software platform to pair livestock producers who have excess solar capacity with solar developers interested in gaining entry into the agricultural solar development market. Our platform will simplify the solar development process and cost structure while providing fixed income via lease agreements to livestock producers with available solar installation capacity. The commercial impact of this project involves significant improvements in solar energy developments in the rural space, coupled with the creation of new channels to finance these technologies. By developing synergistic solar applications in agriculture alongside innovative financing mechanisms, our system can be expanded to work across a variety of agriculture and rural sectors, both domestic and abroad."

The use of rare earth elements are vital for modern life, but the end products are rarely recycled. Recycling often requires the use of very aggressive solvents or high- temperature metal processing, and has not been historically cost-effective or environmentally superior to mining. Future demand is predicted to far outpace the exponential growth of demand for these rare earth metals and cause supply shortages in the future. Rare earth metals mining is heavily concentrated in a few countries, particularly China, which mines and refines the majority of the global supply of rare earth metals. These supply challenges impact the U.S. economy as well as its national security and energy independence, which is a critical DOE concern. New sources of rare earth elements have been identified in the U.S., but opening new mines requires long lead times (10-20 years) and large capital investments. The proposed recycling method will make possible the reclamation of a substantial amount of these rare earth metals by providing a more sustainable and economically feasible solution to their recycling. This new recycling technology is capable of recovering rare earths from complete electronic devices without first removing the rare earth-containing components and therefore providing a significant cost savings in labor compared to other technologies. This process has also been designed from the beginning to avoid costly mitigation steps required in other processes by avoiding the use of acids or other environmentally and economical harmful chemicals and techniques. The Phase I research will build upon proven laboratory results to demonstrate the overall effectiveness of this recycling process in an industry setting with mixed recycling feedstock from commercial sources. The overall objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of recycling devices containing rare earth metals by testing the recovery efficiency and purity of the materials recovered, by validating that the recovered materials can be reused to manufacture metals suitable for commercial production standards, and to show the economic feasibility of the process by examining the byproducts of this recycling process and their potential to contribute to an economically viable recycling process. This Phase I will utilize real-world conditions to demonstrate the process, showing that this technology is ready for further research and development in Phase II work. The successful application of this technology on a commercial scale will enable a nationally sustainable recycling and recovery mechanism with the potential to produce up to 20% of the rare earth magnet raw materials used annually in the United States. This would significantly reduce U.S. dependence on importation of rare earth materials, increasing energy independence while decreasing the risk of monopolistic foreign manipulation of rare earth element supplies and pricing. Commercialization of this process has the potential to generate significant job growth throughout the U.S. in the direct application of this technology in recycling but also in the upstream and downstream sectors of the market. The demand for materials containing rare earth materials will create and expand new and current markets in the material collection and recycling markets. Production of cost-competitive rare earth elements within the nation has the potential to revitalize domestic manufacturing for magnet materials and components."

seen in only 18% of patients in the Phase 3 trial, Lutathera developer (AAA) was acquired by Novartis for $3.9Bln.
Alpha(a)-particle therapy is an exciting-emerging form of PRRT that is producing objective (and even complete)

During MWA, doctors use image guidance to insert a thin needle-like applicator into a target tumor and then energize the microwave antenna embedded in the applicator’s tip to heat and kill the tumor. MWA is especially important to the large population of cancer patients who are poor candidates for surgery or other physically demanding therapies, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, due to tumor location or poor health. All currently available MWA systems are only capable of producing a roughly spherical or teardrop-shaped treatment zone centered on the axis of the applicator, which is not suitable for treating tumors located near critical anatomy or irregularly shaped targets. This limitation often leaves doctors with a difficult choice of risking undertreatment and disease recurrence or risking overtreatment and damage to critical healthy anatomy that may cause pain or life-threatening complications. Directional MWA would allow the physician to instead place the applicator alongside the tumor and direct heat toward the target and away from nearby sensitive tissues. New clinical techniques enabled by directional MWA could facilitate faster, safer, more effective, and lower cost treatment of localized tumors, and potentially broaden the range of diseases that could be treated in a minimally invasive manner. As microwave antennas typically require physically large structures to achieve a high degree of directivity, developing a small diameter ("

Hydrogen is a chemical used widely in industry and serves an alternative fuel source for electric vehicles, increasing drive range and shortening refueling time, but adoption has been limited by the needs for refueling infrastructure. One method to address this is to create hydrogen by splitting water, alleviating the safety, logistical, and reliability issues associated with the delivery and storage of hydrogen, but existing technology has been associated with high capital and operating costs. The objective of this proposal is to advance water splitting technology, enabling a non-polluting, zero-emission hydrogen solution. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an advanced electrolyzer. The project will (1) synthesize the catalysts and fabricate these electrodes on an industrial scale; (2) characterize the relationship between electrode architecture and kinetic and mass-transfer limitations; and (3) identify the electrode architecture, stack compression, and flow rates required to translate the performance of these electrodes to an industrial-sized prototype. The project will utilize mathematical modeling to guide electrode architecture development and a three cell industrial-sized test stack for experimental testing before employing electrodes in a full 4 kg/day stack. Furthermore, the project will employ the electrodes in a 4 kg/day pressurized stack and integrate these components to produce hydrogen at 20 bar to the SAE J2719 standard of 99.998% purity. The projected targets for stack and system efficiency for the final system are 43 kWh/kg and 55 kWh/kg.

EOS must look through the Earth?s atmosphere that induces systematic error in measuring the actual reflectance of ground targets through scatter and attenuation of light. Atmospherically-induced error affects data utility because the atmospheric aerosol content, i.e., humidity, dust, pollen, smoke particles, etc., fluctuates greatly, impacting applications for global monitoring, defense and agriculture. The value of data could make this a significant and growing market opportunity if the specifications are met successfully. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to correct aerosol-induced error in EOS data by reversing the effect, found empirically to be structured, independent of aerosol type and potentially predictable through measurement of dark target-reflectance ? water bodies clear of aquatic vegetation, entrained sediment and specular reflectance from windblown waves. The method of study is extraction and statistical analysis of Landsat 8 data, the standard reference for calibration and validation of data from all other EOS platforms. This problem is approached through a series of heuristic investigations to (1) reconstruct relationships of blue, green and red bands to near infrared (NIR) originally fitted using Landsat 5 and 7 data (longer wavelengths may not be addressed because they are resistant to atmospheric affects), (2) use these relationships to reverse the error, (3) develop methods to select, proof and apply dark targets that calibrate the correction, and (4) measure residual error by comparing post-algorithm reflectance to at-ground reflectance measured by portable spectrometry. The residual error is likely due to uncertainty associated with dark targets. Once developed and proofed, the algorithm will be brought to the Landsat 8 Cal/Val team for validation.

Currently, less than half of the N fertilizer applied to agricultural fields is used by the crops to which it is applied. The remaining N is either leached from the soil or lost to the atmosphere as nitrous oxide - potent greenhouse gas. This inefficient use of N fertilizer by crops is an economic burden for farmers, cause serious water and air quality problems, and contribute about 2.5% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, these N losses represent a tremendous energy inefficiency, because the production of synthetic N fertilizer is the largest energy input in production agriculture. The key to improving N use efficiency in crop production is applying the right amount of N fertilizer in the right place at the right time. The proposed sensor technology would be disruptive to existing agricultural technology and practices, wherein N fertilizer is applied at a uniform rate across agricultural fields, and improve profitability for farmers. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a robust field-mobile soil nitrate (NO3-) sensor utilizing mid-infrared technology to facilitate precision N fertilizer applications. Mid-infrared spectrometers have historically been large, expensive, and fragile laboratory instruments that require substantial sample preparation, thus preventing their use as mobile optical soil NO3- sensors. The scope of the Phase I research will focus on three objectives: 1) The design and development of a robust and low-cost mid-infrared spectrometer that uses a diamond attenuated total internal reflectance (D-ATR) probe to measure NO3- levels; 2) The design, construction, and testing of a chisel shank-tool bar system that houses the spectrometer and D-ATR probe; and 3) the development of control and data processing and analysis software to manage the system. Anticipated technical results of Phase I will provide a prototype that can measure NO3- in the upper 30 cm of soil, not just at the surface, by enabling modulation of the depth of the shank and the probe as the system is pulled through a field, and self-cleaning of the system as soil is continuously moved across the optical surface of the diamond by the forward motion of the tractor.

Gender equality is recognized as an important factor in catalyzing development and lifting communities out of poverty. Empowered women contribute to healthy and productive families, communities, and nations. An important step in doing this is to integrate high quality and timely gender analysis (examination of how differences in gender roles, activities, needs, and opportunities affect men, women, girls and boys in specific contexts), into decision-making and project planning. For both public and private sectors, early, action-oriented gender analysis is vital to tackle improve outcomes. In 2015 - 2016, OECD aid agencies spent, on average, $41.7 billion per year targeting gender equality and women's empowerment. Conservatively estimating that 3-5% of this expenditure is for gender analysis and action planning, that makes a market of $1.3-2.1 billion in the development sector alone. This project can potentially improve outcomes from that development funding. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and test a web-based application that automates the currently manual process of conducting gender analyses. This addresses a real world challenge faced by aid organizations to effectively integrate gender analyses into planning to inform effective and timely decision-making. Despite being a requirement by many organizations, there are procurement and contract delays, shortage of gender experts, and manual research and data collection. This project will develop a machine learning model that leverages big data, APIs, and text-mining, driven by an analytic framework created by experts, to automate this process and deliver customized results instantly for a fraction of the cost.

Current in vitro methods for characterizing gastrointestinal absorption are based on unreliable assays, with 90% of all drugs developed ultimately failing to enter the market. Practically, these limitations delay the development of critically needed therapeutic drugs and dramatically increase drug prices and health care costs. There is, therefore, a critical need to develop more predictive in vitro testing assays that will allow for early selection of the most promising drug candidates to reduce the number of live animal studies and their associated costs, while accelerating transition from pre-clinical research to early drug development. The technology is based on the discovery, fundamental characterization and bioarchiving of adult canine intestinal stem cell lines, called 3-dimensional (3D) canine intestinal organoids. These miniguts emulate the physiology of the functional intestine much more closely than currently available methods and have the potential to provide superior drug screening over currently used assays. This SBIR Phase I is a proposal to establish that in vitro predictability of oral drug absorption can be improved using canine intestinal organoids vs. standard 2D in vitro assays, such as Caco2 and MDCK cell lines. In Aim 1, the goal is to determine intestinal absorption and permeability of therapeutic drugs as a function of disease and intestinal segment as compared with conventional in vitro models. This will be achieved by quantifying passive and active permeability of drugs, as well as drug transporter expression and function in 3D canine organoids vs. conventional cell systems. In Aim 2, the goal is to determine intestinal metabolism of therapeutic drugs as a function of disease and intestinal segment in canine organoids compared to standard in vitro models. Ultimately, quantitative data generated through these experiments will be imported into a commercial software to simulate the disposition kinetics of a predefined set of candidate drugs. Performances of the model predictions will be evaluated by comparing simulated vs. observed drug kinetic plasma data from the literature for validation purposes.

One is that many coal-fired power plants are reaching the end of their life, and the other is that demand for electrical power is expected to increase steadily through year 2050. From emissions concerns, new coal-fired power plants are less likely to be built. While natural gas-powered power plants can cover some of this shortfall, there are concerns with long-term natural gas prices. To this end, small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) are looked upon for a solution. They are inherently much safer than older nuclear power plant designs and less expensive to build and operate. They can also provide process heat for desalination of seawater, manufacture of hydrogen gas, and other industrial processes. To aid economical construction and safe operation of SMRs, Cold Spray, a solid-state materials deposition technology, is developed to apply robust corrosion-protective coatings on SMR components. This process lets many components be made of carbon steel, a less expensive and easier to use material than stainless steels and other high-performance alloys. Cold Spray can apply several different materials, such as 304L stainless steel, pure nickel, pure titanium, or Inconel 625 onto carbon steel for excellent corrosion protection that can tolerate high temperatures. In Phase I, those four materials were successfully deposited onto A516 carbon steel, and in Phase II the long-term corrosion behavior of those coatings will be thoroughly tested. A modular and flexible system to apply these coatings on an industrial scale will be developed and ready to provide to SMR manufacturers and operators. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The process and equipment developed in this effort can be used on an industrial scale to apply robust and durable corrosion-protective coatings to a very wide range of carbon steel components prior to installation, and also to repair damaged components on-site. Examples include truck suspension parts, bridge components, welds in ships, storage containers for hazardous materials, and many others."

The severeconsequences of microbiological contamination (e.g. foodborne illnesses food recalls branddamage and economic losses) demand food industry to re-examine the current food safetycontrol strategies and introduce novel technologies for controlling the microbial cross-
contamination. Persistent pathogens have become a big threat to food industry especially onnon-food-contact surfaces. Even the bacteria-killing procedures cannot fully eliminate thecontamination from these surfaces with the ready-to-eat foods. One potential solution is tomodify non-food-contact surfaces with anti-microbial coatings to control cross-contamination.We will focus on achieving the durability and scalability of the antimicrobial coating systemsthrough the combination of advanced coating chemistry and formulation. There are foursupporting objectives: 1) Obtain coating thickness and adhesion that can survive 3 months ofsanitation scrubbing. 2) Prove that the coating is compatible and non-reactive to normalsanitation chemicals. 3) Validate that the coating is effective against multiple listeria persistentstrains. 4) Validate that the coating prevents biofilms forming for up to 3 months in-service. Ifsuccessful the new coating system will offer a practical and sustainable solution to controlfoodborne contaminants and greatly enhance the food safety."

Head rice--
which is the mass of milled rice kernels that are at least three-fourths of the original kernel lengthafter milling of brown rice--is the high-value portion of processed/dried rice. National revenuelosses related to HRY recovery in 2015 translated to ~$240 million (26 million bushels - HRYequivalent). Therefore the ability to prevent reduction in HRY values is critical to the rice industryand has significant economic impact on rice producers. The investigators propose to demonstratefeasibility of using 915-MHz microwave heating to dry freshly harvested rough rice in a one-passprocess that is not currently attainable using conventional means by pursuing the following threetechnical objectives: determine the (1) specific microwave energy required to achieve one-passdrying of rough rice; (2) extent to which microwave energy used affects millability of rice; (3)relationships among supplied specific energy during microwave treatment and the resulting HRY.The level of performance targeted is to achieve one-pass drying to a moisture content of 12.5-13%wet basis with HRY >65%. This level of success from the current average HRY of 58% which isachieved through conventional multi-pass drying will translate to a $145 million increase in ricevalue annually. Following proof-of-concept in Phase 1 the researchers anticipate to performdetailed studies in subsequent phases to optimize quality characteristics of dried rice and move thetechnology towards commercialization."

The greatest source of ahighly educated population in rural areas is native individuals who attended college locally orwho return home after completing their education elsewhere.To guarantee that students haveopportunities to enter STEM careers in rural communities their schools must provide a high-
quality education that includes foundational STEM concepts before high school.Sparking mathinterest in elementary school is more effective in creating the motivation to enter STEM careerpaths than are later efforts to encourage high school students to take more-advanced courses.Byeighth grade almost half of students are no longer interested in STEM or believe it is irrelevantto their education.Early STEM engagement is critical. An effective teacher is the mostimportant factor in a student's academic success yet issues including teacher shortages and highturnover rates affect teacher quality in rural areas. This can have lasting effects on thepreparedness of rural workforces to meet the employment demands of technology firms that ruralcommunities are seeking to attract.The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project Math YourWay is to develop validate and commercialize an innovative software platform that pairsSTEM career focused informational texts with customizable problem-solving situations andrd th
embedded simulations to significantly improve elementary and middle school (3 -8 grade)math and literacy instruction.The innovation of the Math Your Way program is the ability topersonalize problem-solving instruction through text simulation and problem customization andtargeted adaptive feedback.This allows teachers to meet the needs of all students in diverseclassrooms so they can learn in their individual zones of proximal development. Phase I SBIRObjectives are designed to demonstrate concept feasibility of 1) allowing mathematics teachersto improve disciplinary literacy instruction; 2) enabling teachers to differentiate problem-solvinginstruction more effectively than is possible with teachers' current differentiation methods; 3)using Math Your Way to better teach students to solve real-world problems; and 4) using MathYour Way to increase student interest in and appreciation for STEM; and 5) positively impactingthe socio-economic development of rural areas.A pilot test and usability study followed by ard th
feasibility study for 3 -8 grade teachers and students will provide qualitative and quantitativedata before and after use of the platform.Data will be analyzed and compared with controlclassroom data.Potential Commercial Applications:StarrMatica's initial target market is rural school districtswith over 9.1 million students and ~916000 classrooms. We will expand that market to includeelementary and middle schools across the U.S. given that only 40% of fourth graders and 34%of eighth graders nationwide are proficient in math as measured by the 2018 NationalAssessment of Educational Progress.The primary drivers in the target market are the needimprove math performance and to provide personalized learning.The top K-12 technologyspending priorities on the 2017-2018 Center for Digital Education survey were:1) personalizedlearning and 2) digital content/curriculum.

These methods have a high limit-of-detectioncorresponding to > 1 Million CFU/mL.The proposed sensing-approach relies on two phenomena. First: LAB can be killed rapidly usingantibiotics that have minimal effect on yeast-cells. Second: this death can be monitored in real-timeusing microchannel Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (m-EIS). Briefly m-EIS relies on the factthat because living cells have a non-zero membrane-potential exposing them to a high-frequencyAC field results in charge accumulation at the cell-membranes (electrical-capacitance). Loss ofmembrane-potential accompanying cell death results in a drop in this capacitance. Hence if analiquot from a yeast inoculum is exposed to said antibiotics and monitored using m-EIS one shouldsee cell-death (drop in capacitance) only if LAB are present.In Phase I we will demonstrate the ability to detect LAB at concentrations as low as 100 -1000CFU/ml (3 orders-of-magnitude lower than incumbent methods). It is expected that screeninginocula using this technology will result in fewer incidences of ""stuck fermentations"" and alsoincrease the productivity of other cultures."

Today’s boar semen processing and handling techniques have been largely unchanged since the 1980s. The newly identified, but long-­‐time existing technical problem is that current techniques promote non-­‐desired biological events during storage that shorten the in vivo lifespan, deem a considerable portion of spermatozoa subfertile and for pre-­‐mature cell death, and reduces overall pounds/sow/marketed due to inefficient use of superior genetics. Opportunity: Managing the identified problem can 1) increase sow litter sizes, an opportunity cost of $1 billion per 5% increase in piglets per litter marketed and 2) lead to better use of swine genetics, an opportunity cost of $400 million. Most companies in this space have pulled R&D departments from extender development due to fiscally tight times in the pork industry and lack of high impact scientific findings to translate. Consequently, novel and high impact findings from previous USDA NIFA-­‐funded research has gone without implementation. Herein lies the excitingopportunity to translate recent highimpactfindingstoincreaseU.S.porkproductionefficiency.Project objectives:1)Optimize aliquid boar semen storage buffer that decreases storage-­‐induced, premature and pathological sperm capacitation. 2) Optimize a boar semen buffer that reactivates sperm at time of insemination.

These hearing preservation approaches attempt to preserve the patientandapos;s residual hearing following CI surgery. However, studies have suggested that trauma to the cochlea during electrode insertion results in damage to delicate inner ear structures, and up to 50% of patients experience delayed hearing loss following surgery that results in a diminished quality of life.1 Additionally, recent studies suggest that trauma to the cochlea occurring during electrode insertion may be correlated with changes in Electrocochleography (ECochG) readings taken from the cochlea. In this SBIR, iotaMotion aims to develop an insertion tool that couples cochlear implant ECochG measurements to a micromechanical control system that will assist the surgeon to sense, predict, and mitigate cochlear insertion trauma in real-time during electrode insertion. The anticipated impact of this technology will be to improve short and long-term hearing outcomes for CI patients by enhancing “hearing preservation” cochlear implantation. The project will develop a functional prototype with insertion control algorithms for a “smart” insertion tool and then evaluate the systemandapos;s feasibility in a pilot animal study via the following three aims:1) Develop a Working Benchtop Prototype of a Real-Time Intracochlear Damage Monitoring and Insertion Tool. The first stage of development will comprise the design, fabrication, and testing of the device in a laboratory setting; demonstrating that the insertion tool can be controlled and regulated by the novel hardware and software inputs. 2) Evaluate the control system EcochG feedback sensitivity and reliability with motion control algorithms that utilize real-time feedback to prevent intracochlear damage. Aim 2 will develop several firmware control algorithms that detect ECochG changes with a feedback loop to the control console and motor unit for micromechanical motion adjustments. This will help determine the relationship between ECochG readings and electrode movement within the cochlea. 3) Demonstrate proof of concept capability to assist the surgeon during electrode insertion based on real time ECochG feedback in pilot large animal study. The final specific aim will evaluate the prototype device in vivo with a pilot animal model. The ability of the device to sense and mitigate ECochG changes through motion adjustments will be validated. Ultimately, the success of Phase I will allow development of this insertion system to progress to a second iteration of the design (based on the knowledge gained in Phase I) and further in vivo testing to establish the efficacy of the device as compared to the current gold standard of implantations. SBIR funding will help secure additional outside investment and bring us closer to commercializing this much needed treatment for people suffering from disabling hearing loss.Project Narrative: Despite the many advances in cochlear implant technology, recent clinical trials have found that up to 50% of patients who undergo “hearing preservation” cochlear implant surgery can experience continued hearing decline after surgery; likely due to intracochlear trauma experienced during electrode insertion. To address this issue, iotaMotion aims to develop an insertion tool that couples cochlear implant ECochG measurements to a micromechanical control system to aid the surgeon in sensing, predicting, and mitigating cochlear insertion trauma in real-time during electrode insertion. This SBIR Phase I project will develop a working prototype and demonstrate the capability of the device in an in vivo model; thereby establishing the feasibility for continued development and commercialization to eventually reduce the incidence of residual hearing loss for the millions who are candidates for receiving cochlear implants."

Concepts of organic chemistry are central to medicine and pharmacology. However, organic chemistry
represents a significant hurdle for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics students in pre-health
tracks. Low exam scores and high failure rates result from the enormous amount of information, complex
chemical structures and dynamics, and processes requiring creativity and spatial thinking. The challenge is
often exacerbated because students try to memorize facts rather than understanding foundational concepts.
Students from underrepresented groups and first-generation college students are often disproportionately
affected. Today’s undergraduates are acclimated to dynamic 3D interactive environments, which present a
promising learning alternative to static texts or on-line programs. However, no comprehensive solution is
available in organic chemistry.
Here, we combine our expertise in user experience, game design, visualization, and science education to
create innovative, gamified software aimed at making teaching and learning organic chemistry more effective,
engaging, and relevant. Interactions with key organic chemistry concepts are designed around proven problem
solving strategies and delivered through focused, session-based exercises. Exercises facilitate real-time
feedback, provide the opportunity for students to interact with both 2D and 3D molecular visualizations, and
harness effective gamification techniques to encourage replay.
During Phase I we developed a minimum viable product (MVP), Mol Stereochemistry, which comprises about
10% of the first semester content. Learning outcome assessments by students from two classes at Des Moines
Area Community College showed an average test score increase of 9% after 30 to 45 minutes of using the
MVP. Over 90% of students indicated the MVP provided a “great” or “very great” user experience. Our Phase II
leverages the robust educational and computational framework established in Phase I to develop Mol Organic
Chemistry (Mol), a mobile-first, next-generation digital learning environment. The modularity of the existing
framework will enable us to scale Mol content to encompass all of Organic Chemistry I including reaction
mechanisms, International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry nomenclature, structural determinations by
spectroscopic imaging. This full content will be combined with context-based gamification mechanisms such as
performance-based bonuses, achievements, daily and weekly challenges, and setting and tracking learning
goals to promote recurring use. New usability and accessibility features will provide accommodations for
differently abled students, and instructor-centered tools allow for modification of content and integration with
learning management systems. Working with academic collaborators at Texas Aandamp;M University we will conduct
a large-scale, longitudinal assessment of about 1,000 undergraduate organic chemistry students. Taken
together, Mol will drive student learning outcomes, and facilitate adoption by instructors.Project Narrative
Organic compounds and their interactions constitute the very foundation of life and now
provides the basis for the fields of toxicology, pharmacodynamics (the effect a drug has on the
body), pharmacokinetics (how the body metabolizes a drug), and rational drug design (using
understanding of a biological target to design new drugs). Our Phase II project leverages the
robust educational and computational framework established in Phase I, as well as proof of
positive learning outcomes, to develop Mol Organic Chemistry 1 (Mol), a mobile-first, next-
generation digital learning environment. The modularity of the existing framework will enable us
to scale Mol content to encompass all of Organic Chemistry I, add new usability and
accessibility features, and provide instructor-centered tools and integrations, therefore driving
student learning outcomes and facilitating adoption by instructors."

Kidney transplantation is a clinically effective and cost-effective treatment for patients suffering from end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) and diabetes. Twenty-two patients die each day waiting for a transplant and 30% of all
deaths in the US could be prevented by organ transplant. Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effective
advantages of kidney transplantation, there has been a decades-long rise in the kidney discard rate from 5.1% in
1988 to 19.2% in 2015. During a successful Phase I grant and to address the need for a dedicated communications
system to help improve transplant patient outcomes and achieve greater donated organ utilization, HealthTech
Solutions (HTS), Inc. developed a proprietary mobile application for secure team communication tailored
specifically for kidney transplant teams. To further improve communication efficiency and augment critical
decision making in healthcare, specifically for surgeons, HTS will employ machine learning (ML) powered
clinical decision support. Clinical decision support (CDS) may significantly increase access, increase quality, and
reduce the cost of kidney transplantation. The proposed project is designed to further test and quantify the
improvement of the donor management, coordination process, and kidney utilization outcomes using the
company’s CDS and communication infrastructure for medical team communication. The aims are; 1) Develop
CDS models specifically for transplant professionals aimed at improving decision times and decision confidence.
Develop the CDS infrastructure capable of handling medical data and serving insights safely, securely, and
rapidly; 2) Asses usability by working with a test group to exceed usability criteria and ensure that CDS meets
clinician needs through user feedback iterations. Verification of utility from a diversified testing group (n=10)
that represent every type of professional involved in transplant cases. 3) Measure the effects of TXP Chat
enhanced with CDS after live clinical implementation in the kidney offer and procurement processes for more
than 3,000 offers (1,500 with CDS and 1,500 control) over a period of 365 days with multiple partner institutions
(n=3). TXP Chat and CDS will demonstrate to be reliable, secure, trustworthy and useful by the clinical/technical
community, increase kidney acceptance practices resulting in an increase in kidney transplants, reduction in cold
ischemic time, and reduction in time from offer to transplant. Ultimately, these metrics have been demonstrated
in the literature to improve patient outcomes, reduce expensive chronic treatment costs (e.g. dialysis), reduce
patient deaths from lack of kidney availability, and significantly improve human health and productivity. Study
results will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Aim 1 will lay the foundation for further
development to enable wider CDS in the Phase IIB. Aim 2 will prove physician support and steady adoption trend
as we roll into commercialization. Aim 3 will provide multi-center pilot study data used to prove increased
efficiency of the process in terms of time, money, and total number of kidneys transplanted.Project Narrative
Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effectiveness advantages of kidney transplantation for many patients,
nearly 1 in 5 kidneys authorized for donation are discarded. This project addresses the need for an efficient
communications software technology enhanced with clinical decision support tailored for organ procurement
organizations and transplant centers. Combined with enhanced communication efficiency, clinical decision
support powered by machine learning may significantly improve donated kidney utilization and increase the
number of viable, but currently unused organs that could otherwise be successfully transplanted, reducing
waste and saving lives."

Accurately diagnosing epilepsy is very challenging and time consuming because clinicians rarely observe the
actual seizure, and there are many different types of seizures and epilepsy syndromes with differing
presentations. Furthermore, other neurological disorders can be mimics of seizures leading to erroneous
diagnosis, inappropriate treatments with significant potential adverse events, incorrect prognoses, and
significant waste of healthcare resources. A primary indication that is mistaken for epilepsy is psychogenic
non-epileptic seizure (PNES) which is commonly misdiagnosed even by seasoned clinicians. Patients that
suffer PNES events experience convulsive events which are similar to epileptic seizures but do not arise from
aberrant, synchronous, electrical activity in the brain. Rendering a definitive diagnosis of either PNES or
epilepsy is critical to long-term patient health and outcome. Currently, obtaining a definitive diagnosis of
epilepsy or PNES is expensive and inconvenient for patients as it may require inpatient evaluation and a
battery of costly tests. To address this unmet need Evogen’s predicate SBIR proposes to further develop an
accurate diagnostic blood test that can be used to stratify transient neurological events as either PNES or
epilepsy. This work will include collecting additional patient samples to confirm pilot results. Upon confirmation,
a streamlined development plan has been created to collect all of the information required for CLIA
accreditation and bring the test to market.
In tandem with scientific development, Evogen has developed an initial commercialization plan and with this I-
Corps administrative supplement we propose to create a comprehensive, effective, and multi-faceted
commercialization and launch plan. Our previous market research has established that patients and health
care professionals are overwhelmingly enthusiastic and ready to embrace such a test. In a survey of 115
physicians, 97% reported that they would be a “very likely” to use the test as part of their diagnostic workup for
suspected epilepsy patients. Evogen is eager to embark on the next step of our commercialization plan under

polyclonal ATG, Thymoglobulin – rabbit polyclonal ATG) and have found broad use as immune tolerizing agents,
particularly for induction therapy in a majority of tissue transplants, for acute transplant rejection, and as
treatment for graft vs. host disease following bone marrow transplants. Early clinical trials also suggest ATG may
have a role in immunomodulation to treat the underlying autoimmunity of type 1 diabetes (T1D). However,
animal-derived ATG products can result in serum sickness 5-15 days after administration as the recipientandapos;s
immune system reacts to these xenobiotic immunoglobulins, rendering any subsequent redosing particularly
problematic. An agent that could combine the beneficial effects of the current animal ATG products but avoid the
xenobiotic responses would bring significant advantages to each of these therapeutic areas. This proposal seeks
to produce potent fully human ATG polyclonal antibodies by immunizing transchromosomal bovines (TcBs) with
human thymocytes in combination with a strong adjuvant and immune stimulator. TcB-derived fully human
polyclonal ATG antibodies (SAB-142) will have potent activity and would eliminate the risk of anaphylaxis and
serum sickness associated with xenobiotic IgG products. Success of this proposal will result in an IND filing that
will facilitate a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy.
Previous studies have demonstrated that TcBs can produce large amounts of human polyclonal antibodies with
extremely high titers and neutralizing activity against various antigens, including viruses, proteins, bacteria, and
whole cell antigens following multiple immunizations. A phase I clinical trial has shown that the human antibody
products produced by TcBs are safe and well-tolerated in healthy subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02508584). In
this proposal, SAB Biotherapeutics, Inc. (SAB) and Sanford Research intend to expand our earlier proof-ofconcept
studies to produce a human ATG polyclonal antibody product (SAB-142) using SAB’s innovative human
antibody production platform technology (diversitAb™) and evaluate the antibodies in pre-clinical studies. There
are two phases in this project: Phase 1 – (1) Evaluate and compare SAB-142 with ATGAM and Thymoglobulin
for direct cytotoxicity toward conventional T cells, (2) Examine SAB-142 affinity toward red blood cells (RBCs),
and evaluate the effects of RBC adsorption on SAB-142 binding to peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and (3)
Evaluate and compare SAB-142 with ATGAM and Thymoglobulin for binding affinity to multiple subsets of
PBMCs. Phase 2 – (1) Production of two naïve TcBs for SAB-142 production, (2) Immunization and plasma
collection from TcBs for SAB-142 production, (3) Purification of a pre-clinical lot and a clinical lot (cGMP) of SAB-
142 for use in Aims 4 and 5, (4) Develop and qualify a target-specific potency assay based on the results of the
phase I aims, and (5) Complete IND-enabling pre-clinical evaluation of SAB-142.The research proposed in this application seeks to produce a fully human anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) product
(SAB-142) in transchromosomal bovines that express human polyclonal antibodies for transplant induction/acute
rejection therapy and potential immunomodulation therapy to treat the underlying autoimmunity of type 1
diabetes, as suggested by early clinical trial results. SAB-142 will combine the beneficial effects of current animal
derived ATG products, while eliminating the risk of anaphylaxis and serum sickness associated with xenobiotic
IgG administration. Development of SAB-142 will bring significant advantages to each of the established ATG
therapeutic areas, while advancing our understanding of the underlying autoimmunity of T1D."

Commercially available biosensors are designed to measure only one molecule at a time at a given recording
site. This is a problem because chemical signals in the brain do not work in isolation; rather, neurotransmission
involves many chemical species simultaneously released and little is known about how specific
neurochemicals fluctuate relative to one another. Understanding these relationships is critical to the
development of drugs and treatments for a wide range of neurological disorders. The Sombers Lab has
established the feasibility of using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) and carbon-fiber microelectrodes for
the simultaneous detection of rapid dopamine fluctuations and those of non-electroactive species, such as
glucose, at the same recording site. This is done with higher spatial and temporal resolution than currently
available methods. The goal of this Lab to Marketplace: Tools for Brain and Behavioral Research SBIR is to
translate and commercialize the technology developed by the Sombers team at North Carolina State
University. The first goal is to transfer the core technology for the co-detection of dopamine and glucose from
the Sombers laboratory to Pinnacle Technology, a company that has developed, manufactured and sold
biosensors and electrochemical measurement systems worldwide. Pinnacle-produced sensors will be fully
characterized and detailed specifications for the technology (sensitivity, linear range, shelf-life and benchmarks
for in vivo performance) will be outlined. The second goal is to develop training tools and software to minimize
the learning curve associated with the proper implementation, characterization and analysis of FSCV in
research or pre-clinical applications. This will be accomplished by modifying existing Pinnacle software to
create an intuitive platform for acquisition and analysis of voltammetry data using the commercial probes.
Finally, high production value training videos will be created and made freely available on the Pinnacle
website. These will detail experimental procedures for all aspects of in vivo voltammetry including probe
calibration, surgical procedures, and data acquisition and analysis protocols. Overall, this project is innovative,
because it departs from the status quo by utilizing the redox activity inherent to enzymatically generated H2O2
to identify targeted non-electroactive species, even in the presence of electroactive molecules that are typically
excluded as interferents. It is significant, because it combines two state-of-the-art and well-characterized
technologies for neurochemical monitoring in a clever, straightforward, and unprecedented manner to provide
the community with an established tool that can be used to study the role of glucose in complex physiological
processes ranging from basic endocrine function to motivation. It promises to have a transformative effect on
neuroscience by allowing researchers interested in diverse aspects of brain function to better understand how
these specific neurochemicals rapidly co-fluctuate in discrete brain locations.NARRATIVE
This effort will enable researchers to simultaneously measure multiple chemicals at a precise
point in the brain. In any given year, 1 in 4 adults in the United States report some type of mental
illness resulting in an economic cost of approximately $318 billion annually to the US economy.
While symptoms of mental health disorders are well known, the underlying causes are not, and
the probes resulting from this effort will greatly aid the search for understanding and the
development of cures."

As SRAS is materials processing agnostic, it can be used for both legacy manufacturing methods (i.e., casting, forging) and emerging manufacturing methods (i.e., additive manufacturing, metamorphic manufacturing). Further, the data that it generates is the type of data that would flow into rapid qualification strategies, digital twins, and fleet performance and maintenance strategies. While the technique has the potential to be a transformative way of quantifying material state in a manufacturing environment, there are some technical barriers that must (and will) be addressed.

Through the development of new materials and additives, composite structures can also afford Fire, Smoke and Toxicity performance, resistance to high temperatures, and long-term durability and toughness. The Navy currently makes use of composites in many critical and demanding applications, specifically to address corrosion issues as well as for weight reduction. Lower weight structures provide for a more stable vessel, and offer opportunities to add on critical hardware that simply wasn’t feasible at the current weight.

The overall goal of this project is to design, test, and validate the thermal salt sealing system for nuclear waste disposal and conventional well plugging and abandonment. To achieve this goal, the project Work Plan will include three tasks: (1) numerical modeling of the thermal salt sealing process, (2) development and bench testing of several prototype borehole heaters, and (3) in situ field testing and post-analysis of the system within an active salt mine. As an outcome of these tasks, we expect to provide the U.S. Department of Energy and private industry with a thermal salt sealing technology that can create an impermeable and impervious barrier of native salt.The primary commercialization opportunity for our technology will likely occur through well plugging and abandonment in the salt cavern industry. Several thousand underground salt caverns have been solution-mined throughout the world. As these caverns age, they eventually reach the end of their economic life and must be plugged and abandoned to ensure human safety and avoid environmental risk. However, a suitable long-term solution does not currently exist for plugging and abandoning salt cavern wells. By developing and deploying our proposed thermal salt sealing technology, we will provide a suitable plugging-and-abandonment solution for salt cavern wells and capitalize this opportunity, while also protecting the environment and human safety."

Cell factories are responsible for producing more than $150B worth of cell therapies, protein therapies, industrial enzymes, and small molecules each year. At the development phase, there are few technologies to monitor viable cell concentration, a critical quality attribute in a large array of bioreactors. Current methods to monitor cell viability are labor intensive, expensive, and can compromise quality. The proposed technology could be embedded into the walls of disposable flasks and bioreactors to provide real-time measurement of viable cell concentration. This could enable substantial ""big data"" improvements for bioprocess developers, clonal selection, and small batch production. This STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate passive, wireless sensing of viable cell concentration with resonant sensors. Dielectric probes are used in industry to correlate culture capacitance to viable cell concentration in large culture volumes. In this proposal, the change in culture capacitance in small culture volumes could be wireless reported with a passive sensor embedded as part of the disposable culture flask or single-use bioreactor. In this form factor, it would never make contact with the cell product, would be wirelessly implemented, and would have potential to be easily multiplexed. Technical objectives for this work are 1) determining the extent of confounding signal effects from movement, media composition and temperature; 2) building a Bluetooth enabled reader pad for implementation in an incubator; and 3) developing an algorithm that translates the complex resonant sensor amplitude and phase data into simple parameters that can be used to track viable cell concentration. In addition, the plan is to model and test the effect of resonator geometry, material composition, and sensor placement.

Every year, approximately 1,200 severe mistreatments happen in radiation therapy. Radiation therapy lawsuits
rank in the top third of all medical specialties with an average of $313,000 per claim settled or litigated. The
current method for detecting treatment errors is by a weekly patient chart check, where each treatment record
is manually reviewed on a weekly basis. This labor-intensive and inefficient method prevents us from detecting
the treatment error at an early stage. Here we propose a novel software system, ChartAlert, for automating
patient chart checking. ChartAlert is a prospective real-time adaptive electronic checking system that can be
configured to support different clinical workflows and perform “smart” check using artificial intelligence. It
supports two major treatment databases (Elekta MOSAIQ and Varian ARIA) in radiotherapy. In Phase I project,
we have successfully developed ChartAlert for MOSAIQ prototype that is under clinical testing in two treatment
centers. Our preliminary results demonstrated the significant improvement of effectiveness in patient chart
checking and the flexibility of supporting different workflows. In this Phase II proposal, we will continue the
ChartAlert development. We will demonstrate the feasibility of the ChartAlert approach and its advantages over
the standard manual checking method. We will develop a prospective checking module, develop the ARIA data
translation module for ChartAlert for ARIA, design and implement an AI-based “smart” check module, and
verify the proposed system at the partner sites. Successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the
feasibility and commercial potential of the ChartAlert approach. Ultimately, this work will result in an intelligent
patient chart checking software, which will increase patient chart check efficiency, save staff time, improve
cancer patient treatment safety, and preventing potential lawsuits.Project Narrative
Treatment errors in radiation oncology occur at a rate of 2% per patient, and radiation therapy lawsuits rank in
the top third of all medical specialties with regard to claims made, claims paid, and damages. Current methods
of detecting treatment errors are manual and inefficient. There is a critical need for efficient treatment error
detection in order to improve patient safety and save cost. We propose to develop a scalable and
comprehensive software system (ChartAlert) for automated patient chart error detection in radiation therapy.
ChartAlert can be extended to other types of patient charts to check treatment and prescription consistency
and improve patient safety."

The intended application is to replace Cr-plated Al and Ti parts on the Air Force Sikorsky Combat Rescue Helicopter. PEO-treated surfaces offer a unique combination of excellent adhesion (from conversion of the part surface with no abrupt interface), high wear-resistance from the hard crystalline-alumina material and good corrosion resistance from the noble crystalline-alumina surface. This unique conversion process uses environmentally-friendly, non-hazardous electrolyte solutions that reduce handling and disposal costs.

Wildfires cause hundreds of billions of dollars in annual damages in the United States. As the size and number of wildfires increases, prescribed fires have emerged as one of the most cost-effective tools to reduce catastrophic damage by removing excess fuel for wildfires and controlling their evolution. Yet, to be most effective, prescribed fires require putting people in the proximity of fire and are often limited by the unavailability (due to cost or demand) of fast delivery mechanisms such as those provided by helicopters. This effort will result in technology that directly addresses both pain points by improving the intelligence of drone-based fire monitoring and ignition systems. This project has the potential to shape how fire management is conducted in the future, making it safer for fire personnel and enabling cost-effective prescribed fire practices that can help society to control catastrophic wildfires and better manage landscapes. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the development of drone-based technology that will transform fire management. Current drone-based ignition and monitoring systems have the potential to change the field but are hampered by their extensive reliance on human controllers. This lack of automation limits these systems? potential applicability, scale, effectiveness, and unnecessarily increases their risk. The proposed work aims to make monitoring and ignition more intelligent and scalable through: 1) specialized machine learning pipelines to characterize fire fronts and identify ground assets; 2) light-weight fire simulation engine that can provide short-horizon prediction of the fire front evolution while executing on limited computer power; and 3) distributed planning algorithms that adjust the drone's trajectory and sphere drop strategy to manipulate fire intensity while keeping ground assets, vehicles, and personnel safe. These challenges are especially difficult to address given the harsh fire environment, the weight and power constraints of commercial drones preferred for these activities, and the integration of two distinct domains, drone navigation and fire management.

This allows the codes to retain the performance of native code, while allowing them to interact with other Python libraries and data structures (e.g. MakeHuman, Blender, BulletPhysics, etc.). This also allows us to deliver the code in formats that are useful across the model development cycle, and to different users who may have variable needs we make the code accessible via: 1) integration/extension of Blender's GUI through a custom input panel, 2) via a scriptable command-line interface, and 3) as an importable Python module which can be used to generate training data on-the-fly during model development, training, validation and testing (essential!).

Improvements in neutron detectors for use at high-flux pulsed neutron sources are required for materials research involving neutron scattering experiments conducted at Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories, including single crystal diffractometers, neutron reflectometers, and time of flight (TOF) measurements. Generally, requirements for neutron detectors used in these facilities include spatial resolution on the order of 100 µm or less, neutron-detection efficiency exceeding 60% for 1-2 Å wavelength neutrons, ability to operate at rates exceeding 20 MHz with minimal dead-time, and gamma-ray rejection ratios of less than 10-6. Advances in sensor design, read-out technology, and data processing algorithms are required to meet these challenging requirements. These requirements will be met by integrating a Dual-Sided Microstructured Semiconductor Neutron Detector (DSMSND) with the Timepix3 read-out chip to create a detection assembly (the X-DSMSND) and software, capable of tiling into large imaging arrays. The objective of this project is to design, develop, fabricate, and test a neutron detector with very-high thermal-neutron detection efficiency and excellent spatial resolution, capable of operating in intense neutron fields. Previous researchers have shown that Timepix-based neutron detection is capable of sub-10 µm resolution via pixel interpolation. In the Phase I project, several modifications of the current single-sided X-MSND design will be implemented to achieve the desired product. First, the DSMSND, which has demonstrated thermal-neutron detection efficiencies in excess of 69%, will be used as the sensor. The DSMSND presently consists of a conformal p-i-p junction read out with complicated bipolar electronics; for compatibility with a single pixel read-out chip, a DSMSND consisting of a non-conformal p-i-n junction will be created. Next, the frame- based Timepix read-out chip will be replaced with the Timepix3, which offers a data-driven read-out for a maximum hit-rate of 80 MHz and provides both pixel-wise time-over-threshold (useful for direct imaging) and time-of-arrival (useful for TOF measurements) simultaneously with the same spatial resolution as the Timepix, which is a 2-cm2 array of pixels with 55 µm pitch. Finally, simulations and models will be updated to accommodate the DSMSND geometry, signal formation characteristics, and demonstrate gamma-ray rejection-ratios on simulated data using energy and cluster-morphology discrimination. The product of Phase I will be a prototype single-assembly detector with laboratory read-out electronics and software. Phase II will focus on refinement of the X-DSMSND sensor design, perform pixel-wise energy calibration, demonstrate 2 x 2 tiling capability, develop more condensed readout, and mature associated software. Furthermore, the X-DSMSND hardware and software performance will be tested at the KSU TRIGA Mark II Nuclear Reactor Facility and facilities such as the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center and the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The novel solid-state neutron detector array design will benefit a wide spectrum of applications beyond those of neutron scattering instruments. The scientific and commercial impact from the proposed research is expected to be significant, where the technology can meet the imaging demands of new generations of neutron scattering instruments. The neutron-imaging device has direct applications in many areas of science and engineering, such as high-resolution neutron radiography/tomography, neutron diffraction studies for stress/strain measurements in materials with internal defects, and surface diffraction studies of coatings."

Soil with a higher hydrogen content will tend to slow down (i.e., thermalize) neutrons rather than absorb them, thereby depressing the fast and epithermal components of the neutron energy distribution while enhancing the thermal component.The primary objective of the proposed effort will focus on the integration of a neutron detector onto a space-worthy mobile platform. An integrated mobile platform provides numerous benefits compared to a stationary instrument, in that it provides greater area coverage and high spatial resolution data. The mobile platform chosen is the CubeRover, currently being developed by Astrobotic Technology, Inc. under a Phase II SBIR contract 80NSSC18C0037. The CubeRover was selected due to its light weight and ability to support the power and data requirements of the neutron detector. The proposed neutron detector is the Omni-Directional Multichannel Neutron Energy Identification Instrument (OMNI), which is currently being developed by Radiation Detection Technologies, Inc. under Phase I SBIR contract 80NSSC18P1952. Whereas both ongoing SBIR contracts are focused on the development of a standalone system, the proposed effort will focus on integrating both systems together (called NeuRover) to provide a mobile neutron detector for lunar volatile characterization and mapping. Furthermore, the resulting technology can be infused into several lunar missions and deployed at numerous locations on the lunarnbsp;surface. The NeuRover can effectively look for water ice on the lunar surface, which allows for unmatched vertical and lateral spatial resolution.nbsp;"

Furthermore, the shading and shelter provided by the solar installation saves costs related to animal production efficiencies and health. In Phase I of this project, we will develop a solar panel mounting and tracking system that integrates with pre-existing concrete cattle feed bunks and can withstand the rugged conditions associated with year- round use on a cattle feedlot. This system will allow producers to offset their high electricity costs with solar power while synergistically providing shade and shelter for their cattle.

fatal. Responses to targeted and immunotherapies can be remarkable, but low response rates, acquired
resistance, and adverse side effects limit long-term quality of life for these patients. The overall response rate to
all therapies remains dismally near 50% and the 5-year survival is andlt;25%. Preclinical studies have identified
radiolabeled peptides that target the melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) as a potential therapeutic alternative. While
this approach using -particle emitters has been largely ineffective preclinically, previous publications and our
Phase I data have demonstrated efficacy of Viewpoint’s MC1R-targeted VMT01 -particle therapy in mice
bearing melanoma tumors. Thus, VMT01 is designed to meet the significant unmet medical need to improve
outcomes for these patients (initial indication of progressive stage 4 metastatic melanoma), with potential for
expanded indications in combination with FDA-approved melanoma drugs (e.g., immunotherapies). In this
revised Phase II SBIR project, Viewpoint will complete a Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial to determine the
safety of its companion diagnostics. It is further expected that the company will have gained a preliminary
understanding of the effectiveness of [68Ga]VMT02 imaging (PET) to identify MC1R positive tumors and the utility
of [203Pb]VMT01 imaging (SPECT) for performing patient dosimetry for personalized [212Pb]VMT01 -therapy.

with Mayo Clinic and 203Pb supply with Lantheus Medical Imaging; CRO for statistics/clinical data (Compleware,
Inc.); and a radiopharmacy partner (Hotshots Nuclear Medicine) for manufacturing/distribution of [203Pb]VMT01.
EQUITY INVESTMENTS: Viewpoint has secured $650,000 in equity investment to establish manufacturing of
212Pb generators for future clinical therapy trials. The company will complete the following Aims toward its goals.
AIM 1. Secure FDA “safe to proceed” designation to conduct the Phase 1 imaging trial of [203Pb]VMT01
and [68Ga]VMT02 under IND.
AIM 2. Complete a Phase 1 safety and biodistribution study of [203Pb]VMT01 and [68Ga]VMT02 imaging in
human subjects and demonstrate their utility for identifying MC1R positive tumors and performing
patient-specific dosimetry.
OUTCOMES: We expect to demonstrate the clinical safety of [203Pb]VMT01 and [68Ga]VMT02. We further expect
to develop preliminary understanding of the efficacy of [68Ga]VMT02 PET/CT to identify MC1R+ tumors and the
utility of [203Pb]VMT01 SPECT/CT for patient-specific dosimetry for [212Pb]VMT01 -therapy. Thus, we will be

The technology is based on in-planta sensor technology that will allow farmers to more carefully and precisely tailor nitrogen applications to each part of each field. By monitoring nitrate accumulation within plants, farmers will receive real time readouts of which fields and which portions of fields are nutrient constrained and could produce more yield following the application of additional nitrogen fertilizer. These readouts also will identify those fields that already have sufficient nitrogen, meaning that further applications would simply reduce farmer profit and environmental sustainability. Widescale adoption and use of these sensors will not only improve farmer profitability, but also improve water quality and ecosystem health via reductions in agricultural losses of reactive nitrogen. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an in-planta sensor for monitoring nitrate concentrations in plants at low cost and in near real time. Existing stalk nitrogen measurement must be conducted in a laboratory setting, requiring farmers to collect samples, mail them to a testing lab, and wait from one to two weeks to receive test results. The cost of the laboratory testing is high enough that only a fraction of farmers conducts nitrogen testing. The in-planta nitrate sensor technology will allow farmers to appropriately sample their fields and provide rapid feedback, allowing farmers (or their crop advisors) to incorporate the data into real-time decisions. This project seeks to develop an in-planta sensor through the fusion of silicon-based microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology and novel nanomaterials. The project will overcome major technical challenges through improving materials, fabrications, packaging, and validation, including optimizing MEMS fabrication processes to minimize sensors at low cost, improving packaging robustness for sensors, and validating sensor prototypes in a greenhouse. The in-planta sensor will directly detect stalk nitrate concentrations with minimal invasion, while being robust to interference from other ions present in the plant stem or stalk. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Only 30-60% of nitrogen fertilizer is taken up by crops.Large amounts of nitrogen fertilizer are lost to the surrounding environment representing aneconomic loss to farmers and diminishing air and water quality. These challenges apply to cerealcropping systems around the globe. In addition nitrogen fertilizer loss represents an enormousamount of wasted energy: every kg of nitrogen fertilizer synthesis delivery and applicationgenerates ~1.4 kg of CO -C. Although soil and water nitrate testing has been proven to reduce2

""Manage the Nitrogen Cycle"" as one of 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21 Century.And on 2018 the National Academies of Engineering Medicine and Science identified low-costhighly sensitive field-deployable sensors as one of ""five breakthroughs required to address urgentchallenges and advance food and agricultural science"".EnGeniousAg's Phase I proposal aims to develop low-cost highly sensitive sensors that cancontinuously or instantaneously measure nitrate in soil and water. Several novel aspects ofour sensors promise to overcome current limitations with ion selective electrodes including signaldrift non-target ion interference and high cost and have the potential to revolutionize nitrogenmanagement. However at this stage our sensors require several fundamental improvementsbefore commercialization including addressing problems with signal instability and sensor fouling.This Phase I project will allow us to test hypotheses that lead to improvements in sensorperformance and to ultimately validate the feasibility of producing consistently accurate sensors.Success in Phase I will naturally lead us to a Phase II proposal that will be focused oncommercializing the consistently functional sensors for rugged field conditions. At a cost of $1-
2/measurement successful sensor commercialization would provide data that can improveprofitability and reduce the environmental impact of farms across the globe. Soil nitratemeasurements can improve nitrogen fertilizer prescriptions while drainage water nitrate sensorscan measure outcomes and identify fields that would benefit from more intensive nitrogenmanagement practices. No longer would nitrogen fertilizer application decisions be based ongeneralized conventional wisdom or a few soil samples that require days of laboratory processingbefore data are available to the decision maker. In contrast hundreds of instantaneous data pointswould enable up-to-the-minute down-to-the-square-meter decisions. There is a large existingmarket for soil and water nitrate testing that will expand with the commercialization of low-costhighly accurate field-deployable sensors. For example the state of Iowa has 87500 active farmswith an average size of 350 acres. In 2014 the Iowa Farm and Rural Life Poll indicated that 87%of Iowa farmers use plant and soil testing to guide fertilizer inputs and nutrient management.Moreover the 2015 Iowa Farm and Rural Life Poll determined that more than 60% of Iowa farmershave increased use of soil and plant testing since 2013 due to societal pressure to improveenvironmental outcomes as well as new technologies that enable precision nutrient application.University Extension recommends at least one sample for every 2.5 acres of cropland. If weestimate that 50% of Iowa farms annually test plants and soils at the recommended resolution(87500 farms * 50% * 350 acres / farm · 2.5 acres / sample * $10 / sample) total expenditureson testing could exceed $60 million per year. Because Iowa’s 30M corn acres represents ~⅓ of
the US corn acreage, the potential nitrate testing market for US corn production alone is likely
>$150M annually."

Cold spray technology offers an effective solution to repair corrosion damage that can be applied at low temperature, therefore minimizing substrate heating, maintaining dimensional stability, and avoiding unwanted thermal effects (HAZ, thermal stresses, dilution layer formation, etc.). The repair will arrest crack growth, protect from further corrosion damage, and fully restore load carrying capacity of the component, and can be applied in-situ, eliminating the otherwise necessary component removal process. In phase I, the project team down-selected appropriate cold spray-able nickel powder materials, established baseline processing parameters, optimized the cold spray material deposition process, evaluated the structural properties of the repair, analyzed the corrosion resistance of the cold spray material, optimized the cold spray material through the development of post-deposition heat treatment, established working relationships with a LWR manufacturer, a DOE National Laboratory, and a large owner / operator, identified several target components for repair, established long term transition targets, and designed equipment modifications to enable in-situ repair within the LWR facility. The cold spray repair process can be applied at low temperatures, resulting in a material with exceptional structural properties that is more noble than 304L Stainless Steel or Alloy 600, which minimizes galvanic effects and prevents further corrosion at the repair site, making cold spray an ideal solution for structural repair in corrosive environments. The phase II project will implement design modifications allowing in situ repair, further develop cold spray processing parameters, surface preparation techniques, and repair geometry effects, and develop statistically assured material property data for future structural implementation efforts. Additional cold spray materials will be investigated for feasibility and applicability, and the cold spray material will be analyzed in greater detail, using elemental analysis, advanced mechanical testing techniques, and stress corrosion crack testing under relevant conditions. Finally, phase II will demonstrate a cold spray repair on a component supplied by a large owner / operator. This effort advances the state of the art in cold spray repair and develops the foundation for ASME code consideration, directly in line with the DOE’s need for in situ mitigation and repair of corrosion damage in LWR’s, offering owners / operators a cost-effective means of plant sustainment and reducing the overall maintenance burden of aging reactor components. This repair approach also improves the safety of LWR facilities, which provides both a benefit to the plant owner / operator, as well as the general public."

The envisioned socio-economic impact is significant: Continual exposure to whole-body vibration and shocks can cause discomfort, reduction in work performance, and chronic low-back pain for vehicle operators and passengers. Low-back pain is the largest component of disability among all occupational-related injuries. Though so-called ""active"" seats can help reduce these vibrations/shocks, their high cost is a major barrier. The low-cost seats being pursued here could benefit millions of vehicle operators. The work will also result in a greater scientific and technological understanding of the sources/effects of and potential remedies for whole-body vibration and shock. The suspension system market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.11%, by value, from 2016 to 2021. The market is expected to grow from USD 52.38 Billion in 2015 to USD 67.22 Billion by 2021. The market for bus seats alone is expected to be at $10.03 Billion by the year 2022. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the feasibility of a quasi-semi-active seat (QSAS) technology. Seating design for heavy equipment and vehicle operators has faced a trade-off between performance and cost. The most-complex 'active seats' reduce vibration but are cost-prohibitive at $3,500. Semi-active seats are simplified active seats and perform better than passive seats, but still magnify input vibration and cost several thousand dollars. Passive seats are the least expensive, but they magnify input vibration at low frequencies. Recent design/material advances and strong preliminary data set the stage for developing an innovative passive seat at a fraction of the cost of semi-active seats that will reduce input vibration at low frequencies. Phase I feasibility will be shown using sliding friction to mitigate vibration at low frequency. A QSAS prototype will be built and used to show potential in laboratory and field settings. Technical challenges will involve material selection that will show maximum vibration mitigation and dissipation, as well as integration of the cushion with a suspension system that can handle the weight of a seated person. The research will determine effective performance parameters under different magnitudes and frequencies of vibration that simulate realistic operational conditions.

The revolutionary technology will be a disruptive force to the $40 billion nylon polyamide industry by addressing nylon?s weaknesses such as undesired moisture adsorption, which results in loss of dimensional stability and tensile strength. These shortcomings lead industries to make compromises in selecting their materials; for instance, longer chain polyamides are used for moisture resistance but at the expense of desired viscoelastic properties. The proposed bio-advantaged monomers will 1) help ease reliance on petroleum-based chemicals resulting in greener production processes and a cleaner environment, 2) present new opportunities for innovation and use of performance plastics due to the platform that bio-advantaged monomers offer. This is expected to generate new jobs at multiple points in the value chain. Demand for agricultural goods by fermentation facilities will increase. Sumatra Biorenewables and its partners will create jobs to meet demand for monomer production and purification. Finally, polymer producers and the manufacturing industry will produce superior products, increasing the competitiveness of the U.S. chemical industry. The intellectual merit of this project is to combine fermentation and chemical conversion for the production of bio-advantaged monomers and their corresponding performance-enhanced polyamides. The inexpensive, robust, and efficient monomer production process in conjunction with the customizable nature of bio-advantaged monomers to yield nylon derivatives that are hydrophobic, flame retardant, anti-static, or otherwise tailorable, afford opportunities to meet a number of needs in the manufacturing sector. The innovation?s success hinges on a monomer production process that utilizes an inexpensive electrochemical conversion that operates near 100% efficiency and that only uses water as a reactant and electricity as an energy source. In addition, the monomer production process is insensitive to the feedstock source and the impurities present in fermentation broths. Therefore, separation and purification is only required after monomer production, resulting in huge cost savings. Laboratory-tested samples of hydrophobic nylon perform equally well as dry nylon, but without the disadvantage of moisture sensitivity. This project will enable Sumatra Biorenewables to transition to a continuous flow, kilogram-scale, production process and supply potential customers with samples for performance testing.

Sepsis and septic shock are one of the leading contributors to death in US Hospitals, responsible for 250,000 deaths annually (estimated at 30-50% of all hospital deaths). To combat these high death rates, time is of the essence. The administration of targeted (versus broad-spectrum) antibiotic therapy in the first five to six hours of septic shock increases the likelihood of survival by roughly fifty percent. This project combines electronics and microchannel fluidics to rapidly obtain results on antibiotic susceptibility. The project requires engineering, software development, and method development, resulting in an instrument that utilizes disposable cards to conduct the testing. The resulting product will allow transition from broad spectrum to targeted antibiotic therapy faster (1 day - weeks), leading to major benefits: (1) patient outcomes are greatly improved by faster transition to directed antibiotic therapy; (2) Reduced hospitalization stays (reduced intensive care stays), resulting in significant monetary saving for healthcare systems (estimated at a cost savings of at least $3.75B annually). (3) Reduced broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy reduces the current fostering of antibiotic resistance in healthcare settings globally. This project uses Microchannel Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (m-EIS) to measure the ""bulk capacitance"" (Cb) of a suspension. Cb is a measure of the amount of charge transiently accumulated at the membranes of living cells in a suspension. Cell proliferation results in an increase in Cb, whereas cell death results in a decrease. Using m-EIS to measure bacteria in the presence of candidate antibiotics and doses, is robust, sensitive, and extremely fast, determining, in real time, cell growth, stasis, or death (in approximately 4 hrs). This project will develop a rapid, direct-from-sample, inexpensive commercial system. This is achieved by using commercial MNPs to isolate microorganisms from clinical samples such as blood culture broth, urine, sputum etc., and re-suspending the pathogens in specified volumes of growth media to obtain a suspension containing optimized concentrations of bacteria. Pathogen growth or death is then monitored using m-EIS in microfluidic cards where they are exposed to a range of antibiotic concentrations. The result is a phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility (AST) profile, yielding the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of multiple candidate antibiotics within 4 hours of sample collection. The AST and MIC information is then used to treat infections with targeted therapeutic. The first products utilizing this system/method will focus on urine and positive blood culture broth samples.

Establish a PBFT hatchery in the Port of SD and 4.Grow PBFT from early juvenile to advance juvenilein a protected environment. In addition, this proposal has the potential to assist in population restoration efforts which are desperately needed.The hatchery will be established in southern California, likelyin the SD Bay area. Target customers are tuna ranchers, initially, those located south of SD (export market). The Mexican tuna ranching industry is the initial aim for several reasons: it is a well-established, sizeable, niche market that can be easily serviced from the US. Due to the present fishing limitations and stringent quota system the product of PBFT hatchery technology would find eager buyers in tuna ranchers.

Porcine S. suis disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in weaned piglets and is a significant economic burden on pork producers globally. Losses to the pig industry globally are in the range of tens of millions to several hundred millions USD annually worldwide. Human S. suis disease can be serious and sometimes fatal, which places a heavy societal burden on public health. Infected pigs are the principal source of human infection; hence, an efficacious vaccine to thwart pig S. suis disease will not only increase revenues of pork producers but also significantly reduce the incidence of human infection, and thereby positively impact public health worldwide. A major impediment to development of highly efficacious vaccines to pig S. suis disease (porcine Streptococcosis) is the fact that different variants of this pathogen (i.e., many serotypes and multiple strains within each serotype) cause disease in different geographical regions of the globe. This means that a vaccine that provides exemplary protection against one variant prevalent in a particular region of the world may not necessarily protect against a variant that causes disease in another part of the world. Therefore, for a vaccine, to be effective, must be able to block infection caused by all / majority of the globally clinically relevant S. suis serotypes and strains (universal or broadly protective vaccines). Consequently, from the point of view of vaccine development, it is imperative that the vaccine be made up of components that are ""shared"" or ""conserved"" by the vast majority of S. suis capable of causing disease. An important first step toward such universal / broadly protective vaccines is to identify pathogen components (such as proteins) that are highly conserved across all / majority of S. suis with disease causing potential; however, this is easier said than done and presents a stiff challenge. This is because highly conserved proteins serve indispensable functions to the pathogen and consequently, are ""hidden"" by the pathogen by highly evolved ""decoy"" mechanisms that prevents the host from recognizing these conserved proteins during natural infection. Novel and innovative techniques are therefore required to identify such proteins.The proprietary protein antigen discovery tool (called Proteomics-based Expression Library Screening or PELS) proposed in this project is one such platform for identification of proteins conserved across diverse S. suis. The technology employs highly specific probes, including antibodies, to identify pathogen proteins. Here, PELS will be innovatively applied to interrogate the entire repertoire of proteins (the proteome) produced by individual S. suis variants comprising a group of 15 serotypes / strains, representative of those causing disease globally. Proteins that react with the antibodies are separated from the rest of the proteome of that particular variant and then identified using tandem mass spectrometry. Sophisticated computer-based algorithms (bioinformatics) will then be employed to compare the proteins identified from each variant to arrive at a panel of highly conserved proteins. A subset of these proteins will be further prioritized on the basis of characteristics that render them suitable as vaccine components. Finally, the prioritized proteins will be produced in a purified form and formulated as a vaccine. In this phase I SBIR project, efficacy of such a vaccine will be determined by the ability of the vaccine to protect weaned piglets from experimental disease caused by a S. suis variant with disease causing potential that is not part of the 15 serotypes / strains examined in this study. Further studies, such as those in phase II, will evaluate the ability of the vaccine to protect piglets against d"

Eastern red cedar (ERC) is a major culprit in woody expansion and causes habitat fragmentation for upland bird and other wildlife species, with adverse effects on infiltration of precipitation, induced changes to plant species composition that degrade habitat and reduce domestic livestock utilization. Currently, the common practice is to cut and burn ERC using government cost-share programs and/or at a land owner&#39;s expense, while not generating a beneficial, valued-added product. We propose development and commercialization of a coupled ERC oil extraction/distillation-biochar system to create the following, value-added ERC products: 1. ERC oil extraction/ distillation products; and 2. Biochar.Exploration of methods, coupled systems and processes would be piloted and demonstrated. The energy needs to extract/distill ERC oil reduce its economic return. We propose development ofa coupled system for ERC oil extraction/ distillation and biochar production using the heat from biochar to fuel the oil extraction/ distillation process. We would market the fuel used to extract ERC oil as a biochar soil amendment and recapture some of the heat for complimentary heating efforts, whlle producing a value-added product of ERC oil. We will evaluate the quality of the ERC end products utilizing our coupled system, while refining the system to achieve the simplest, most efficient and economicaldesign to suppport on-farm/ ranch applications and local/ regional rural development opportuntities.The target audience for this innovative solution would be rural businesses and land owners interested in business development and diversified on-farm/ ranch income. Commercialization and marketing of ERC utilization systems and value-added products would occur during Phase 2 after research and development in Phase 1. However, preliminary evaluation of commercialization and marketing of the coupleds systems and ERC biochar/ oil end products will occur during Phase 1 in partnership with regional biochar initiatives and wood product utilization programs. Production of value-added ERC products could supplement rural incomes or be sole industries, while providing environmental benefits."

The greatest source of a highly educated population in rural areas is native individuals who attended college locally or who return home after completing their education elsewhere. To guarantee that students have opportunities to enter STEM careers in rural communities, their schools must provide a high-quality education that includes foundational STEM concepts. An effective teacher is the most important factor in a student&#39;s academic success, yet issues including teacher shortages and high turnover rates affect teacher quality in rural areas. Sparking interest in science in elementary school is more effective in creating the motivation to enter STEM career paths than are later efforts to encourage high school students to take more-advanced courses. Improving science education from the outset by more effectively supporting elementary teachers in STEM instruction can have lasting effects on the preparedness of rural workforces to meet the employment demands of technology firms that rural communities are seeking to attract.The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize a unique, cost-effective virtual coaching framework to improve a teacher&#39;s ability to create high-quality supplemental science lessons resulting in more-effective elementary (K-5) science instruction aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The innovation of the StarrMatica NextGen Science program is its focus on cultivating effective STEM education by improving science instruction for all elementary teachers, regardless of previous training or experience. The key differentiator of this technology is the application of the known effective strategy of coaching in a digital environment through a ""virtual science coach"" framework. Components of the framework--including a content examples library, content evaluation tools, a research-based instructional model, lesson-self assessment tools, student science notebook interface, and data-recording features--work together to create a comprehensive science instruction improvement solution that is economical, time-saving, and replicable in every school. A pilot test and usability study, followed by a feasibility study for both pre-service and in-service teachers, will provide qualitative and quantitative data before and after use of the System. Data will be analyzed and compared to determine change or gain in scores.The release of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) in 2013 compounded the already numerous issues that elementary teachers have with teaching science effectively. Teachers can&#39;t use their current aging science curriculums to meet the NGSS; however, fewer than 10% of schools plan to purchase a new science core curriculum, so teachers will need to learn to use supplementary materials to meet the standards. SNGS is expected to help teachers meet the NGSS by a) addressing the significant problems elementary teachers face with science instruction; b) overcoming the professional development geographic limitations of rural schools; c) providing a consistency of curricular materials in high-turnover rural schools from year to year and teacher to teacher; d) facilitating the instructional shift teachers must make to meet the NGSS; e) providing a comprehensive lesson-creation framework that coaches teachers through each portion of the lesson planning process in a way that improves teacher pedagogy; and f) being comprised of components that are designed based on research. Our research will show that SNGS is easy to use for both novice and experienced teachers and assists them to effectively develop high-quality science lessons.

This discrepancy is often the most profound in rural school districts. This impacts teachers&#39; abilities to help students acquire strong skills in reading--for instance, nearly two-thirds of American 4th graders can only read at or below a proficient level, and these students scored worse on informational texts than on literary passages--with students eligible for free lunch scoring the worst on informational texts. Beginning readers are primarily exposed to literary texts, and when they begin to read informational texts, they have difficulty with comprehension--which requires a different set of strategies and skills than those they have previously developed. Rural school districts face additional challenges, with fewer resources, geographic isolation, difficulty in attracting and retaining experienced teachers, and higher poverty rates. The Phase II development of StarrMatica Texts: Science Your Way is intended to offer a digital solution to rural districts. This software combines an online professional development component with an innovative process for enabling teachers to tailor informational texts to their students of diverse reading abilities. Rural districts under tight budget constraints will benefit from the fact that StarrMatica&#39;s new program is expected to cost as little as 10% of currently available &#39;informational texts&#39; programs.The overall goal of the Phase I project was to demonstrate the feasibility of this digital program to more effectively support teachers in helping students read and comprehend informational texts. In Phase I, we achieved each of our objectives and demonstrated that elementary teachers were able to customize multiple features of an informational text, individualize informational text comprehension instruction for students, and combine Common Core-aligned ELA instruction with NGSS-aligned instruction. Phase II will continue this research by developing the library of informational texts to include: a) selections that address all Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS); b) Lexile-leveled texts above and below grade level; c) supplementary materials that support NGSS instruction; and d) a robust online professional development program. In Year 1, data will be gathered from thirty teachers participating in a usability study that includes evaluation of the software and professional development. In Year 2, fifty teachers will participate in a validation study to demonstrate improvement of informational text instruction, increased student informational text comprehension, and effectiveness of online professional development. Data will be collected through classroom observations, interviews, surveys, and beginning and end-of-the-year student reading assessments and compared against control classrooms to evaluate success for Phase II objectives.StarrMatica Texts: Science Your Way is expected to enable teachers to effectively individualize informational text comprehension instruction for all students in their classrooms; improve student informational text comprehension; facilitate the integration of informational texts with standards-aligned science instruction; and enable teachers experiencing online professional development to use the platform as effectively as teachers who receive in-person professional development. Our product&#39;s very low cost, digital delivery, ability to meet multiple curricular goals, alignment with Common Core and Next-Generation Science Standards, and online professional development make it uniquely relevant and valuable for meeting the needs of rural schools."

Reliability of UASs in unforeseen conditions is a direct function of their intelligence and adaptability.The proposed project aims to take advantage of high-performance computing platforms and the state-of-the art machine learning and verification algorithms to develop a new intelligent, adaptable, and certifiable flight control system with learning capabilities. The autopilot system will be able to learn from each flight experience and develop intuition to adapt to a high level of uncertainties. To provide a high degree of assurance and to make the learning autopilot system safe and certifiable, a secondary and conventional autopilot system will be integrated based on the run-time assurance architecture. A monitor will be developed to continuously check aircraft states and envelope protection limits, and handover aircraft control to the conventional autopilot system if needed. Provable guarantees of the monitor and the controllers will be provided using formal analysis. The propose a hybrid flight control system which has adaptability and intelligence of skilled pilots and at the same is cable of performing complex analysis and decision making algorithms in real-time.

While RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using short-read nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) have proven to be a useful tool for identifying specific RNA modifications, there still remains technical challenges. These technical challenges include: [1] a harsh bisulfite conversion generating RNA fragments followed by a required purification step; [2] an intermediate cDNA synthesis protocol to incorporate necessary 3' adaptors followed by a required purification step; [3] a PCR protocol (to incorporate 5' library barcodes) to create a heterogeneous pool of sample library templates for NGS sequencing that may require optimization while promoting potential sampling bias and still another required purification step; and [4] a quality control step to verify library enrichment with correct base-pair size distributions prior to sequencing. Importantly, using any of these pre-analytical steps, important RNA modification information can be lost. Exonuclease Time-of-Flight (X-TOF) is a transformative single-molecule sequencing technology specifically aimed at addressing each of these challenges by employing a sequencing-bysubtraction approach for the detection of methylation status (or other types of modifications) imposed on single molecules (ribonucleotide monophosphates, rNMPs) generated sequentially from full-length native RNA species. The workflow is intended to be simple requiring only purified RNA as input without the need for bisulfite conversion, eliminating the need for cDNA synthesis and PCR, and incorporates an internal quality control RNA to verify system performance. Compared to existing single-molecule sequencing strategies, such as the Oxford Nanopore's MinION, X-TOF provides the following unique attributes: [1] Uses multiple singlemolecule identifiers (time-of-flight, TOF; current transient amplitudes) to identify nucleotides with unprecedented accuracy - >95%; [2] can process input samples, RNA,"

Peripheral artery diseasePADaffects overmillion people worldwide and can result in life threating
complicationsCurrentlydrug coated balloonsDCBsare used to treat lesions in the peripheral arteriesHowevercommercially available DCBs are designed to treat only a single blockage siteIn PAD patientscomplex lesions involving longdiffuseand or multiple blockages are often found resulting in the use of
multiple DCBsWith each DCB being very expensive and the procedure time consumingthere is a need in the
market for a multiple release DCB that can release the drug at multiple arterial locations which can reduce the
number of DCBs needed for a procedureThis will ultimately result in the reduction of costtimeand
complications of DCB procedures involving complex lesionsA single release DCB was recently developed by Tailored Medical DevicesIncusing polyethylene
oxidePEOas a platform to control the release of the drug paclitaxelPATThe developed PEO balloon has
shown to be safe and effective in a pre clinical setting for the treatment of a single blockageWith modifications
in the single release PEO balloon formulation and coating strategya multiple release PEO DCBMR PEODCBhas been developedA recent pilot study showed that equivalent drug uptake and retention can be
achieved in two arteries using a MR PEO DCBThe goal of this project is to develop a sterile and
biocompatible MR PEO DCB that can deliver PAT for the treatment of complex lesions and investigate the
reproducibility of the drug retention in two different arterial locations for up todays using a porcine modelSpecific AimDevelop reproducible and sterile MR PEO DCBs in a cGMP facility
The MR PEO DCBs will be developed in a GMP facility through the use of sterile instruments and solutions
used to produce the formulationsThe physicalthermalchemicaland drug release properties of the MRPEO DCB coating will be tested using imagingcalorimetric techniquesand an established in vitro flow modelThe developed devices will then be tested for sterility according to established USP testing methodsSpecific AimTest the cytotoxicity and hemocompatibility of the MR PEO DCB
The cytotoxicity and hemocompatibility testing will be conducted as per the FDA guidelines for the short
exposureandlthblood circulation devicesCyotoxicityhemolysisand complement activation will be
assessed by the exposure of the device or its extracts to the appropriate cell linesSpecific AimTest the drug retention and plasma drug levels after MR PEO DCB treatments in vivo
In vivo swine studies will be performed to test the reproducibility of drug retention at dayand dayA successful outcome of this proposal will be to develop a sterile and biocompatible multiple release
DCB that can obtain therapeutic and equivalent amounts of drug in two arterial locationsFuture phase II
studies would include long term animal studies on tissue retention and healing responses Project Narrative
Peripheral artery disease is frequently associated with complex lesions including longdiffuseand or multiple blockages that currently requires the use of two or more drug coated balloonsDCBsfor treatmentWe have identified a formulation and coating strategies that allows for a
safe and effective treatment of these lesionsIn this projectwe propose to develop a multirelease DCB that will be able to treat these complex lesions with the use of a single DCB to

Amphibious vehicles operate on the leading edge of an assault and in environments where ongoing access to fuel is limited. More efficient fuel usage will also enable longer mission durations and increased operating ranges. The goal is to reduce fuel usage over the Amphibious Vehicle mission profile by 10 to 15%. These vehicles must also operate in harsh environments, including water and off-road conditions. Solutions that reduce weight, particularly un-sprung mass, can improve fuel efficiency while also improving ride quality and water performance. Reducing vehicle weight through composite components favorably reduce ship draft, allowing the AV to ride higher in the water, reducing both pressure and frictional drag. The preliminary assessment of weight saved is conservatively estimated to be ½ ton. This would reduce the vehicle drag by approximately 1.33% (each pound of weight savings will result in 0.0374 lbs. of drag reduction). Using composite materials for the design and fabrication of structures can provide desirable benefits beyond just saving weight; they most benefit in AAV in extreme environments (high stresses, fatigue, multi-axial loading, high and low temperatures, corrosive environments)."

PGPR can be used to improve crop stress tolerance by enhancing root function; providing nutrient uptake, nitrogen fixation, hormone regulation, and suppression of soil-borne pathogens. Treating crops with PGPR is a viable approach for economical and sustainable plant production. However, a major bottleneck to PGPR commercialization comes from poor survival and performance of PGPR strains when used in existing formulations. An improved understanding of critical PGPR interactions with native rhizosphere microbiome members will inform the development of more consistent and effective PGPR formulations. The technology platform consists of a microwell array system that forms 104 - 105 unique combinations between a fluorescently-modified test species and a defined collection of root microbiome members isolated from plant rhizosphere, then screens each well for survival and growth of the test species. Cellular material in wells that show symbiotic or antagonistic interactions with the test species is removed for genomic analysis to identify the members influencing the test species function. The goal of the Phase I proposal is to provide the existing microwell technology with new capabilities that are key to its commercial pathway. Objective 1 will adapt the technology towards screening interactions of known PGPR species in Populus rhizosphere networks. Objective 2 will develop a user-friendly, highly-automated image analysis tool that can rapidly quantify large data sets generated by the platform to identify wells containing important PGPR interactions. The software accessory is expected to dramatically enhance the utility of the existing microwell tool, moving it towards a marketable product. The project will also leverage a well-established collaboration with colleagues working in the DOE-funded Plant Microbe Interfaces Project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to meet these objectives."

In clinical use, a directional MWA applicator will facilitate both procedural and technical simplification of MWA treatments, saving time and critical resources in hospitals, and ultimately improve quality of, and access to, cancer treatment for a broad range of patients. The research and development proposed in this project will enhance scientific and technological understanding of miniaturized MWA antennas capable of radiating with directional patterns. Specifically, special materials to reduce required antenna dimension and increase efficiency, and advanced antenna designs to maximize the size of directional ablation zones will be studied during this project. Commercial development of the proposed technical advances could expand their use for the treatment of other medical conditions or for applications in other industries such as wireless communications. This STTR Phase I project will contribute to the creation of technology jobs in Kansas, a region where there are few medical or technology companies. This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a commercial proof-of-concept directional microwave ablation (MWA) applicator. MWA procedures offer cost-effective, minimally-invasive treatment options for localized tumors and other disease. These treatments are especially important to the large population of cancer patients who are poor candidates for surgery or other physically demanding therapies. However, currently available MWA systems employ applicators with omni-directional radiation patterns, which if not placed precisely may damage critical healthy tissues or result in disease recurrence. A directional MWA applicator can facilitate technical and procedural simplifications which to alleviate these current challenges. We will investigate: (1) alternative materials to shrink antenna cross-section and (2) novel antenna geometries to maximize the size of directional microwave ablation zones. We will employ an approach integrating multiphysics computational models, benchtop experimentation in ex vivo tissue, and experiments in animal models in vivo to design, optimize, and validate our device.

In Phase I, NCI proved the concept of MS-PVD of the solid-state electrolyte (produced at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT)) on carbon-coated copper anodes. Single solid-state cells with thicker electrolyte layers produced at SDSMT confirmed the performance of the proposed solid-state electrolyte for ASSBs. The MS PVD method will be used in Phase II to fabricate multilayer ASSB architectures to accommodate lithiation/delithiation and enhance the contact resistances between the electrolyte and electrode layers. Adjustment of the MS-PVD parameters will produce the required tailored structures, such as thin, dense glass-ceramic electrolyte layers and high-voltage cathodes with balanced electronic-ionic conductivity. These structures are expected to provide mechanical integrity, safety, and required performance during the long-term ASSB operation.

Remotely-controlled systems have a proven record of entering dangerous environments in support of search-and-rescue or similar operations. These environments may instead contain sources of radiation; yet, few attempts have been made to incorporate radiation detection capabilities into these systems. The proposed modular radiological survey imaging system (MRSIS) can potentially fill this need. The MRSIS coupled to a drone could be used for routine maintenance checks of nuclear facilities, military operations, and source search scans, including efforts to monitor residual radiological contamination at important sites (Hanford). In addition, the MRSIS’s designed modularity will permit a single system to adapt to many unique or changing situations. The MRSIS will leverage previously developed next-generation radiation detection technologies, that are compact, light-weight, low-power. The COTS neutron and gamma-ray sensors will be packaged in a configurable system, paired with GPS and reach-back communication electronics. The MRSIS will be developed to serve as both standalone units and as part of a mesh network of multiple detector units. The MRSIS can be distributed around an area of suspected contamination (via drone, personnel, or air-drop) where they can record their findings along with a synchronized timestamp and GPS location and either report measured radiation levels in real-time or record and store them for later retrieval. The MRSIS can also be worn and/or held by an operator in order to provide ground-level walkabout mapping of radiation levels. Should an ultra-wide-area survey be required, the MRSIS can be mounted to a remotely-operated drone to provide a rapid survey of a radiologically-contaminated area. The low-cost, long single-charge operational lifetime radiological monitors are suited for use in applications that require geo-tagging (through GPS and motion sensors), data- logging, and long-range reach back (through integrated GSM or similar radios). Real-time, wide-area 2D mapping information will provide a safety level not presently achievable by contemporary radiation monitors and survey methods."

Cosmic-ray interactions within the lunar soil will yield secondary neutrons and protons, among other particles. The produced neutrons will travel within the soil, scattering off of materials such as hydrogen. Interactions with hydrogen will greatly reduce the energy of the neutrons, causing a measurable depression of epithermal neutrons. A measurement of the ratio between thermal and epithermal neutrons can therefore yield an understanding of the hydrogen content of the soil.  A previous collaboration between Radiation Detection Technologies, Inc. (RDT), Kansas State University (KSU), and Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has developed and produced an instrument which is capable of accurately measuring the hydrogen content of soil based on neutron emissions from the surface.  The TRL 3 instrument utilizes alternating layers of neutron moderator (HDPE) and solid-state neutron detectors, with each incremental detector layer more sensitive to higher-energy neutrons than the previous. The NES can effectively scan for water at the lunar surface from zero altitude, which allows for unmatched spatial resolution. Proposed in Phase I, existing computational models will be refined and validated using the existing NES in real-world measurements. The updated computational models will be used to design a space-worthy instrument that will serve the purpose of determining the moisture content of the lunar soil. An early feasibility study will be conducted to determine what weaknesses exist in the present design in terms of survivability of the instrument under the worst of lunar conditions. In Phase II, the proposed assembly will be developed to TRL 6, wherein a roving prototype will be built and tested."

Electrolyzers made with these new catalysts have the potential to deliver higher efficiencies and lower capital costs than currently available systems. The market for hydrogen today is $115 billion per year. Currently, hydrogen is primarily produced via steam reformation of methane. Hydrogen production via steam reformation emits millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere annually. There is broad agreement that water electrolysis can play a significant role in future hydrogen production if cost reductions can be realized. In addition, hydrogen has the potential to store energy produced by renewable energy systems like solar and wind and make it available on demand. The initial market entry point for these new electrolyzers is to supply hydrogen for fuel cell powered forklifts used in material handling. A life cycle cost analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has shown that the total life cycle costs of hydrogen fuel cell forklifts are 10% cheaper than those using lead acid batteries. The intellectual merit of this project is focused on the ability of new earth-abundant non-precious metal catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to dramatically lower costs while improving efficiency in water splitting. The HER electrocatalyst is composed of hyper-thin FeS2 nano-discs and the OER electrocatalyst is nanoamorphous Ni0.8:Fe0.2 oxide. The preferred operating pH for the catalysts are different (pH 7 for the hyper-thin FeS2 nano-discs and pH 14 for the nanoamorphous Ni0.8:Fe0.2 oxide). Preliminary data shows that these two catalysts with the dual-pH membrane can effectively split water with a total overpotential of only 300 mV (1.53 V in a two electrode configuration). This is more than 50 mV lower than the best-known precious metal catalysts, Pt and IrOx, used in current commercial electrolyzers. The project will continue the optimization of these catalysts in the dual-pH electrolyzer stack and also determine if stability and lifetime meet commercial requirements This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By significantly reducing the time to detect viable Mtb and obtain its drug resistance profile in patient specimens, the device being developed promises to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major public-health challenges in the world today, with an estimated 1.5 million deaths in 2013. More alarmingly, the incidence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB is rapidly increasing, especially in low resource environments. Being able to detect the presence of low loads of mycobacteria and gaining knowledge about the drug resistance profile of a particular isolate in 3 days will be a game changer in global community?s efforts to combat the spread of TB (esp. MDR TB). It will lead to better outcomes for patients (less mortality, quicker recovery), and also better public health (less transmission to others and less fostering of drug resistance in populations). The device being developed incorporates two key technologies that enable it to achieve rapid detection and drug-resistance profiling: (1) super-paramagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) functionalized with moieties that bind to bacterial cells, and (2) microchannel Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (m-EIS) that is able to detect in real time the growth or death of cells in suspension. The proposed approach involves (a) using MNPs to collect the ~1000 Mtb cells present in 2-10ml of sputum sample into a small (200ul) of growth medium during the standard decontamination process (b) dispensing the 200ul suspension into 16 microwells, each containing different formulations of freeze-dried growth-media and/or drugs of interest (c) monitoring the cells in each well m-EIS.

Economically, shell-and-tube heat exchange fouling and unplanned maintenance has been estimated to cost in excess of 0.5% of the United States? entire Gross Domestic Product?translating to over $80 Billion annually in wasted expense. The long-term goal of this research is to reduce or even eliminate this societal expense in the years to come, providing reduced power costs to consumers, a cleaner environment, and better financial performance for the user. As another key benefit, this research will provide a springboard for other later applications and developments focused on preventing wasteful water leakage in large pipe structures and buildings and will potentially reduce the amount of chemical usage in water-treatment systems. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address problems associated with shell-and-tube heat exchange failure due to wear, vibration and fouling. Shell-and-tube heat exchange is a core element of the United States economy, and fouling-related damage, wear and process shutdowns cost the economy tens of billions annually. This research project aims to establish the feasibility of developing miniature submersible sensors that detect developing failures in heat-exchange systems in advance to entirely prevent the ultimate failures that now occur. The research has the intended result of integrating micro-sensor tools into a small condenser cleaning ball with the initial objectives of sensing in-tube temperature and velocity data, determining the exact tube location of the sensor ball, developing continuous heat-transfer characteristics to better predict efficiency effects, and?importantly?to develop a platform for future integration of sensors that add new sensing capabilities. As envisioned, this work will result in the development/operation of the first ever sub-1-inch-dia submersible sensor ball that can autonomously measure velocity and temperature inside shell-and-tube heat-exchangers along with precise tube location determination of the ball inside the system for accurate, location-specific measurements."

With much of the facilities reaching the end of their initial 40-year license, and with electricity demand expected to grow, the U.S. needs methods to extend the lifetime of these facilities for up to 60 years. Stress corrosion crack-susceptible nickel alloys are used in approximately 70% of wetted non-fuel areas in a typical facility, which makes the stress corrosion cracking problem particularly widespread, and especially prevalent with extended service life. Repair of damaged components in situ stands as a superior option for sustaining the existing reactor fleet and can result in significant cost savings vs. replacement. VRC Metal Systems, in collaboration with our academic and research partner, the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology propose to develop cold spray processes to mitigate and repair stress corrosion cracked metal components in light water reactor facilities. The repair will arrest crack growth, protect from further corrosion damage, and fully restore load carrying capacity of the component. VRC will also improve the form-factor of the cold spray equipment to allow for transport of the machine throughout the LWR facility and perform repairs in situ, thereby avoiding the cost and time required to disassemble and remove the component. The repair of stress corrosion cracking in power generation facilities, especially primary water circuits, will not only benefit nuclear power generation facilities, but all generation facilities with water loops, which includes fossil fueled facilities. Therefore, the repair approach being developed in this effort will impact a much larger market than just LWR reactors. Additionally, the development of cold spray processing of corrosion resistant material could find applications in other electric generation sectors, such as cavitation repair on hydroelectric turbine blades. The proposed method of sustainment of LWR stress corrosion cracking issues will allow extended operation of the U.S. LWR fleet to drastically reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the nation for another 20 years. This repair approach also improves the safety of LWR facilities, which provides both a benefit to the plant owner / operator, as well as the general public. VRC Metal Systems has a proven track record of success transitioning advanced technologies to DOD customers and prime contractors. We will use our quality program management system to coordinate the multidisciplinary team and ensure a successful phase I and transition to phase II and beyond."

With much uncertainty facing long term, geologic storage facilities, long duration on-site waste storage is being considered. One potential problem facing the existing fleet of nuclear waste storage canisters is chlorine assisted stress corrosion cracking (CISCC) of austenitic stainless steel. While there have been no failures or evidence of failure of any storage systems in use, needed is a cost-effective plan to repair and mitigate CISCC that can be performed in situ and results in a long term and reliable solution. VRC Metal Systems, in collaboration with our academic research partner, SDSM&T, our robotics system developer, Robotic Technologies of Tennessee, propose to apply cold spray technology to mitigate and repair SCC in 304 stainless steel. Cold spray has been shown to arrest crack growth, protect from further corrosion damage, and fully restore the hermetic seal. The small form-factor of the cold spray applicator will allow for the delivery of the cold spray applicator within the canister overpack, eliminating the need to disturb the canister and remove it from the overpack and greatly increase the safety in a potential repair situation. Mitigation of CISCC is both a safety and economic priority for utilities across the country and around the world. It is anticipated that the proposed mitigation method will completely obviate CISCC concerns for new canisters and provide a technologically sound and safe repair solution should evidence of CISCC or corrosion be detected in the existing fleet of dry storage canisters, providing assurance to the plant owner / operator as well as the public. Additionally, the development of robotic cold spray repair of stainless steel tanks could find applications in other energy sectors, such as fossil fuel storage and chemical processing tanks, thereby increasing the potential market for such a technology. VRC Metal Systems has a proven track record of success transitioning advanced technologies to DOD customers and prime contractors. We will use our quality program management system to coordinate the multidisciplinary team and ensure a successful phase I and transition to phase II and beyond."

interrogate the genomics  DNA  RNA  of single cells to understand the complex biologies of normal and
diseased tissues  SCS is not only important for basic research  but also represents a next generation of
diagnostic approaches particularly for cancer  While multiple SCS platforms have been marketed or are
under development  all of these rely on high quality preparations of single  viable cells in a fluid suspension to
enter their respective workflows  This is not a trivial undertaking  as enzymatically digested normal or diseased
tissues contain dead or dying cells and cell aggregates that may confound SCS  Current cell preparation
methods for SCS  such as fluorescence activated cell sorting  FACS  or dead cell removal kits  are suboptimal
in that they    often require a significant investment of time  money and or training     require multiple
protocols  and or    result in a poor yield of viable cells  which is particularly problematic for scarce clinical
specimens  The SynderBio Randamp D team has developed a proprietary approach for separating cell types based
on their differential responses to brief pulses of fluid shear stress  FSS   Our preliminary data supports our
hypothesis that we can use this technology to rapidly  andlt    min  eliminate dead dying cells and dissociate cell
aggregates from cell suspensions  Our Specific Aims and Milestones for this Phase I SBIR feasibility project
are as follows  Specific Aim    Calibrate the performance characteristics of SynderBioandapos s FSS technology for
SCS  Milestone  Achieve      viable  single cell preparation with      yield  Specific Aim    Compare
SynderBioandapos s FSS technology to existing cell preparation methods  Milestones  Achieve significantly better
performance characteristics  andlt   min       viable single cells       yield  with purity comparable to that of
FACS or dead cell removal kits from competitors  Phase II Aims will then be to    transform SynderBioandapos s
current pre prototype device into a commercial ready product     distribute a limited number of these devices
to thought leaders and potential strategic partners in the field  and    expand the side by side comparison with
competing technologies to other relevant applications in the field  Phase II work will be focused on successful
prototyping and in depth testing designed to obtain the data required by potential Phase III industry
collaborators investors to engage in the next steps required for Phase III commercialization  The commercial
opportunity for SynderBioandapos s product is significant  The global cell isolation separation market alone is expected
to reach $    B in      at a CAGR of        SynderBioandapos s technology is also applicable to cell preparation for
other purposes  such as FACS  Thus  we expect the successful development of SynderBioandapos s technology to
have a major positive impact on human health and to address significant commercial opportunities related to
the use of SCS for understanding and differentiating normal and diseased tissue biology PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed research is relevant to public health because we seek to improve the methods for preparing cell
suspensions for single cell sequencing  which is an emerging technology that will allow us to better understand
the biology of normal and diseased tissues and to more effectively diagnose diseases such as neurological
disorders and cancer  Current methods for cell preparation are unsatisfactory because they    require a
significant investment of time  money and or training     require multiple protocols  and or    result in a poor
yield of viable cells  which is particularly problematic for scarce clinical specimens  SynderBio proposes to
develop a novel proprietary method for preparing single  viable cell suspensions faster  cheaper and of higher
quality than is currently possible and to thereby expand the utility of single cell sequencing greatly improving
human health while addressing a multi billion dollar market"

 Current approaches to treat sensorineural hearing loss  SNHL  in newborns suffering from congenital
cytomegalovirus  CMV  infection rely on off label  systemic antiviral therapy requiring high dose  long duration
treatment with demonstrated hematologic toxicity  carcinogenicity  and teratogenicity  Furthermore  it is
unknown whether systemic delivery of antivirals maintain inner ear drug concentrations within an appropriate
therapeutic window for sufficient lengths of time to achieve therapeutic effect  A novel delivery system for long 
term  controlled release of antivirals to the inner ear would constitute a dramatic improvement in CMV related
SNHL treatment options  Our proposed strategy uses Unisun technology to create a long acting single
transtympanic injection of ganciclovir loaded microspheres for round window membrane  RWM  localization
and sustained release to the inner ear  The central advantage of our approach is that Unisun allows for precise
control of particle size  shape  material  and drug release rates 
 Our long term goal is for transtympanic delivery of Unisun enabled ganciclovir loaded microspheres to
be the standard of care for newborns suffering from CMV related SNHL  We hypothesize that microspheres
can be retained on the RWM for over four weeks and that ganciclovir release can be maintained       g day 
to sustain a therapeutic concentration in the inner ear fluid  We expect that this novel approach to localize
ganciclovir treatment to the inner ear will dramatically improve the safety and efficacy of antiviral therapy for
CMV related SNHL over current non FDA approved options 
 Orbis  research team will first develop and characterize the relationship between the microsphere size 
material  drug concentration and ganciclovir release profiles to establish the feasibility of achieving long term 
controlled release to the inner ear  Aim     We will then determine the optimal microsphere immobilization
strategy to enable RWM localization for a minimum of one month with minimal toxicity in a guinea pig model
 Aim     This Unisun enabled drug delivery strategy addresses issues of dosage accuracy and long term
release  In addition  Unisun based encapsulation is highly adaptable and can serve as a transtympanic
delivery platform for multiple drug classes  This unique strategy has significant potential to become the
standard of care for treatment of CMV related SNHL PROJECT NARRATIVE
 Current approaches to treat sensorineural hearing loss  SNHL  in newborns suffering from congenital
cytomegalovirus  CMV  infection rely on off label oral or intravenous antiviral therapy requiring high doses and
long dosing regimens of molecules with known hematologic toxicity  carcinogenicity  and teratogenicity  A
novel localized delivery system for long term controlled release of antivirals  such as ganciclovir  to the site of
infection in the inner ear would constitute a dramatic improvement over existing CMV induced SNHL treatment
options by considerably decreasing the required dose and simplifying the dosing regimen into a single long 
acting injection  Our proposed strategy uses Unisun technology to engineer a transtympanic injection of
ganciclovir loaded microspheres that are designed to remain affixed to the round window membrane of the
inner ear and provide localized  controlled  and sustained release of the therapeutic throughout the treatment

Examination  CBE   medical personnel screen for suspect lesions  that are     to    fold stiffer than
surrounding tissue  by palpation using two or three fingers followed by precession about a fixed     in  contact
area  Typical pressure to avoid discomfort and also feel deeper palpable objects ranges from       KPa 
However  palpation is highly qualitative and subjective  and it is not possible to follow progression in the
morphological changes  The goal of the proof of concept study is to develop an ergonomic  low cost  less than
$   stethoscope like probe to capture tactile images during palpation  The probe will be pressed at       KPa
pressure and a series of images will be recorded in real time by pivoting the probe over a fixed contact area of
about     in  in a precession motion similar to CBE  The studies will be performed over a well characterized
physical model  an artificial breast  and a clinical test on humans  The tactile image would be at a resolution of
      m to image    mm features at       mm depth from the surface with relative hardness of     fold
compared to the surrounding matrix  Two key drivers for developing the technology are   i  digitizing CBE will
offer a screening record between biannual mammogram exams  for women below     and in low income
countries where accessibility to a mammogram is limited  and  ii  the current digital CBE instruments  with
array of   mm size sensors compared to proposed      m size pixels  require rubbing the device on the skin
at constant pressure and speed to create an image by stitching together the frames  potentially causing
distortions smearing due to dynamics of the palpable features  The grayscale of the image for the proposed
device will be linear making the analysis quantitative to detect local hardness and score and track the palpation
over time  The low power of the device will allow connectivity to a USB port for power  signal  and imaging on a
laptop computer or smart phone  To image more complex body topography  such as axillary and cervical
lymph nodes  the design will allow for interchangeable device heads of different sizes  At the heart of the
proposed device is a      nm thick nanostructured film that converts pressure to electrical signal to form the
tactile image  The film is a stratified structure of a monolayer of Au nanoparticles interposed by    nm thick
polymer layers  On pressing the film  the electron tunneling current between the particles modulates to
measure the local pressure  There are two specific aims   i  develop an unpackaged device to prove the
principle in terms of resolution  sensitivity  power requirement for USB connectivity  and ability to image    fold
harder structures      mm in size at depths of      mm using a physical model  and  ii  develop a handheld
device for testing on artificial breast model and limited clinical study with     de identified patients with breast 
pain complaints or who are scheduled for mammograms  The preliminary and published results  by PI  indicate
that the specified resolution  sensitivity  and performance are possible  A US Patent was issued in      Project Narrative
Vajra Instruments will design and build an ergonomic  stethoscope like device that will obtain tactile
images in real time during palpation using a procedure similar to that used in manual CBE  The tool
will be a low power device that may be interfaced with a laptop computer or smart phone to save and
process the images  The nanodevice is scalable for mass production using standard manufacturing
processes and materials used in the microelectronics industry"

mobile STEM game to address difficult to learn topics in organic chemistry  Our first module will focus on
stereochemistry  a notoriously challenging concept facing nearly   million undergraduate students each year
who are pursuing a healthcare career  and another   million biology and chemistry students  Significance 
Organic compounds and their interactions constitute the very foundation of life  The relevance of organic
chemistry to medical research and practice is profound  About half of medicinally used pharmaceuticals 
toxins  and illicit drugs  require chiral centers for their activity  The increasing relevance of organic chemistry to
medicine means that the integration of organic chemistry is more and more important in modern health related
education  Interactive media provides a potentially transformative technology for education  The intrinsic
appeal and intuitive nature of interactive apps to the millennials and the as yet unnamed post millennial
generation makes them a powerful medium for learning  and interactive apps are beginning to take their place
in classrooms as a complement to teacher based lectures  Innovation  The Mol mobile app would provide a
powerful approach to enable student success  learning about the  D shapes and properties of organic
molecules and how these relate to real life health applications  Gameplay mechanics could include spatial
puzzles where the player must correctly identify chiral centers on rotating  D structures  time trials challenging
the player s ability to quickly match the corresponding structure with the nomenclature presented  and a mode
promoting the manipulation of  d models to determine stereoisomerism  and build your own stereoisomer 
Approach  Our team has extensive knowledge in educational game development  notably with the NIH SEPA 
sponsored Meta!Blast  Developed with Unity D  Meta!Blast is now used in college classrooms and in informal
education settings  including being incorporated as a major component of the core Biology Lab at Iowa State
University  It s being evaluated in several biology classroom settings at institutions across the country  one
example is at Chaffey College  Rancho Cucamonga  California  a two year community college with a high
proportion of Hispanic students and veterans  We are confident this experience can be extended to the project
outlined in this proposal  Each aspect of Mol will be developed with user input using a rapid iteration approach 
Bi weekly discussions and formative evaluations will ensure the creation of a product that is engaging  fun 
relevant  usable  and educational  This will be followed by a larger summative evaluation and data analysis 
Commercialization  Through our experience in the rigorous NSF I Corps program  we believe that following a
successful Phase I and Phase II effort  we have the knowledge and support to address the large opportunity in
this market segment  A commercially viable app would be distributed to Android and iOS platforms through
Google Play and the Apple App Store  respectively  As observed in our customer discovery process  students
indicated a significant factor in their adoption of new learning materials would be from a recommendation or
requirement by their instructor  As such  a key element in our marketing strategy is to cultivate relationships
with chemistry instructors and view them as demand creation partners Project Narrative

The goal of this Fast track application is to develop a non invasive diagnostic test  based on MUC  and MUC  
mucins  that can serve as an adjunct to cytological analysis of fine needle aspirates  FNAs  for accurate
prediction of malignancy in patients with cystic pancreatic lesions  Due to asymptomatic nature and lack of
methods for early detection  andgt      of pancreatic cancer  PC  patients present with an unresectable primary
tumor with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis  While the overall   year survival rate of pancreatic cancer
is dismal  signi cantly better outcomes have been reported for smaller tumors detected at an earlier stage  Slow
development of PC in conjunction with the better curative response of patients with early disease underscore
the need of early detection of pancreatic cancer  Pancreatic cystic lesions  earlier considered to be rare  are
increasingly being recognized due to increased number of individuals being subjected to diagnostic imaging 
however  their exact prevalence is unknown  These cystic pancreatic lesions have variable malignant potential 
while mucinous cystic neoplasms  MCNs  and intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasms  IPMNs  have a high
probability of developing into malignant lesions  serous cystic neoplasms  SCNs  are considered benign 
Despite the critical need  accurate discrimination between high  and low risk cystic lesions is challenging due
to their symptomatic and radiographic similarities  Although cytologic examination of endoscopic ultrasound
 EUS  guided fine needle aspirates  FNAs  has emerged as an indispensable part of presurgical evaluation  in
practice          of such analyses are inconclusive and unreliable in discriminating between serous and
mucinous lesions  Using anti MUC  MAb  G  generated by our group several studies have established that
cell surface mucin MUC  is promising prognostic and diagnostic biomarker  Further MUC  and MUC  
exhibited      specificity for malignancy in EUS FNAs containing atypical ductal epithelial cells  The central
hypothesis of this proposal Detection of MUC  and or MUC   in pancreatic tissues  EUS FNAs  is positively
correlated with the presence of already existing pancreatic cancer or cystic lesions with malignant potential and
thus MUC     staining is a powerful tool for the accurate prediction of malignancy and pre surgical stratification
of patients with cystic lesions of the pancreas  Studies proposed for Phase I will result in the development of a
prototype kit for MUC MUC   IHC  Aim    and provide proof of concept in support of the aforementioned
hypothesis  Studies proposed in Phase II will validate the significance of MUC     immunostaining in a blinded
trial and determine how MUC     expression correlates with the clinical outcome of the solid cystic pancreatic
diseases  Aim     Further  we propose to test the prototype kit in a clinical setting  CLIA Lab  to validate
performance  Aim     Overall  the proposal will lead to the development of a clinical test to stratify patients for
surgical intervention or surveillance in the context of pancreatic cystic lesions and PC Project Narrative
Endoscopic Ultrasound  EUS  based Fine Needle Aspirates  FNAs  represent a valuable pre surgical diagnostic
material for confirming the presence or risk malignant lesions in the pancreas  however their diagnostic utility is
limited due to the poor sensitivity of cytological analysis particularly in cases exhibiting atypical epithelial cells 
Accurate diagnosis of malignant lesions of the pancreas can provide opportunity for intervention at a curable
stage and reduce the risk of surgery associate morbidity in patients harboring benign lesions  The proposed
studies will validate if MUC  and MUC   staining in EUS FNAs can predict the risk of malignant lesions and
help in appropriate patient selection for surgical resection"

Cultivars and best management practices are optimized for that growing environment, but may not be suitable for other growing regions. Hops contribute the bitter and aromatic flavors to beer. The craft beer industry is on the rise, with consistent growth over the past five years. Craft brewers desire locally sourced ingredients and unique flavor profiles to distinguish their brews. Locally sourced hops could satisfy that need, but there is not currently enough supply to meet demand.Throughout the Midwest and other parts of the country, rural farmers are faced with declining commodity prices and are looking at alternative crops to supplement lost income. As a solution, regional farmers are beginning to grow hops. However, without regionally adapted cultivars and best management practices, it is difficult for new growers to enter the hop production market.Our proposed project will meet this shortfall in regional information by identifying hop cultivars adapted to the area and developing optimal management practices for producing hops. Additionally, we will gather genetic information on diverse hops plants to resolve relationships, characterize diversity, and identify adaptation traits important for growing hops in the region.The research developed by this proposal will provide a foundation for expanding production and successful hops farming in the area. Our competitive advantage of cultivar evaluations and collaborative partnerships with growers and brewers will establish hop farming and production as a thriving and viable business in the Midwest."

Salmonella is increasingly prevalent in hamburger because this bacteria can infiltrate small tissues of the immune that are unavoidably ground into hamburger. The specific objective of this particular application is to develop a test that identifies black cattle bearing specific genes conferring the resistance. Preliminary data identified: (a) a single gene that confers Salmonella resistance to non-black cattle; and, (b) 34 genes whose diminished activity (expression) correlated with Salmonella resistance as evidenced by decreased infiltration of the pathogen into the immune tissues. These 34 genes all produce proteins that Salmonella has to use during the infection process.Our central hypothesis is that Salmonella resistance can be reliably predicted in black cattle via a genetic test targeting the 34 genes. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that these 34 genes encode proteins exploited by Salmonella during the infection process, and thus minimizing their expression will yield Salmonella resistance. Guided by strong preliminary data, we plan to objectively test our central hypothesis and attain the objective of this application by pursuing the following objectives: 1) To examine a larger group of cattle and confirm that the diminished expression of these 34 genes leads to Salmonella resistance in black beef cattle; and, 2) To identify the gene sequences that lead to the decreased expression in the 34 genes. Under the first objective, our preliminary data will be confirmed using samples from 500 additional animals. Under the second aim, we will sequence the genes encoding the 34 proteins in the top 10% (n=50) of cattle samples in which expression of the 34 genes was the lowest and was correlated with the lowest Salmonella prevalence (percent of cattle infected with Salmonella).The approach is innovative because it will be the first genetic test that identifies black beef cattle that naturally resist Salmonella infections. The proposed research is significant because it will establish a dependable assay for detecting these traits. Ultimately, such knowledge will diminish food borne Salmonella."

Cover crops are crops planted either into standing cash crops (such as corn or soybeans) or in between cash crop seasons that are planted for reasons other than harvesting for grain. Using cover crops can help reduce the amount of irrigation and chemical fertilizers and pesticides used in growing cash crops. Exposure to and consumption of these fertilizers and pesticides have been linked to a variety of health issues. Cover crops also reduce the soil erosion caused by wind, sun, and rain when there is no cash crop in the ground. Another advantage of cover crops is the benefit they bring to soil health, introducing more nutrients into the soil which leads to increased cash crop yields. Cover crops reduce the trips over the field without spreading fertilizer which reduces fuel consumption and compaction of the soil.Part of the reason cover crops are not used, especially on small and midsize farms is that there is no practical broadcast seeder that is affordable for small and midsize farms. Often times the seed distribution is a custom set up to each farmer or is too costly for a small or midsize farm. Developing this broadcast seeder will give a cost effective way for small and midsize farms to plant cover crops.The approach on this project is simple. The first task is to complete the calculations that prove the project&#39;s hypothesis. Then each component of the seeder will be tested separately to validate the calculations and verify any assumptions made during calculations. The last step is to update the design based on the test results and make improvements as needed to produce an efficient and cost effective product.The ultimate goal for this project is to develop a complete and thorough design of a broadcast seeder attachment that is affordable for small and midsized farms. The impact this broadcast seeder will have is to give a more cost effective option to farmers to distribute cover crop seeds in standing cash crops. As more farms use cover crops, less chemical fertilizers and pesticides will be used. This will reduce harmful toxins in the ground and water that negatively affects the health of the population. This also will increase the health of the soil and area water ways, leading to a more sustainable use of agricultural lands."

Selenium is commonly supplemented into animal feed, nutraceuticals, and human food due to its numerous health benefits. Selenium has been reported to prevent cardiovascular and neurological diseases, aging, infertility, thyroid function, and infections. In addition to the benefits to human health, selenium also promotes the growth and productivity of fish, birds, and mammals. Selenium deficiency has also been found to cause various diseases in animals. Despite the obvious health benefits of selenium, many of the sources of selenium such as selenium salts are not bioavailable for human and animal uptake. One source of selenium which is bioavailable is organically bound selenium. A common source of organically bound selenium is in specially fermented selenium yeast; however, this selenium yeast is costly to produce and has some health concerns itself. Due to these realities, a low-cost, sustainable, bioavailable source of selenium is in great need.To address this issue, we propose to develop, optimize, and evaluate a process to produce a microalgae biomass that is high in bioavailable organic selenium. We will use our patent pending revolving algal biofilm (RAB) cultivation system that has demonstrated 10 times higher algal productivities compared to conventional algal culture systems. Additionally, our RAB system does not require the expensive harvesting and dewatering technologies that cripple the economics of conventional algae cultivation technologies. In our preliminary study, we demonstrated that our RAB system is capable of rapid accumulation of selenium in the algal biomass at a very high level. If successful, this proposal will lead to a new bioavailable selenium source that will promote healthy people and animals.Three objectives will be pursued to achieve the goal of developing a new microalgae product high in bioavailable organically bound selenium: (1) optimize selenium accumulation in algae biomass by altering cultivation conditions, (2) evaluate the use of selenium-containing food and feed manufacturing effluent as a free nutrient and selenium source for the algal growth medium, and (3) evaluate the bioavailability of selenium contained in algae biomass.The anticipated results of this project are threefold: (1) the selenium content and profile in the algal biomass will be understood, (2) the bioavailability of selenium in algal biomass will be determined, (3) understand if a previously unutilized effluent stream high in nutrients and selenium from a food and feed manufacturing plant can be used as growth medium for algal growth. Collectively these results will give GWT the knowledge to make a go/no-go decision on the scale up of the RAB system for production of a selenium rich algal biomass."

Patient falls are a common, costly, and serious problem in hospitals and care facilities. CAHs have greater pressures on them over typical urban hospitals due to their typically smaller number of beds and occupancy, older population demographics, smaller operating margins, shorter patient stays, and intermixing of patients of various demographics and with various diagnoses. These challenges present barriers to implementing a cost-effective fall prevention system. The proposed project aims to overcome these challenges faced by CAHs by introducing a mobile intervention system that is effective and flexible, allowing ease of use and integration. The goal of the proposed project is to implement and demonstrate the feasibility of a mobile Automated Video Monitoring (mAVM) system to reduce the risk of injurious falls among adults age 65 and over in CAH settings by detecting unassisted bed exits before they occur. To create the mAVM system, we propose to take a video monitoring system, mount it on a mobile cart unit made for use in hospital settings, and deploy it to CAH rooms to monitor and gather data from patients at a higher risk for falls and fall-related injuries. The data obtained in this step, in the form of 3D video footage of real patients in rooms during their stays at CAHs, will be analyzed in order to gain a better understanding of the specific behaviors that precede and indicate dangerous fall situations. This knowledge will be tremendously valuable to the public good in helping develop this and other technologies that prevent dangerous fall situations, decrease injury, increase overall quality of life, and decrease the overall cost of hospital care. Then, we will use this data to customize an automated video monitoring component and test feasibility of this approach by deploying the prototype mAVM intervention in CAH rooms, using the data collected previously as a comparative baseline to demonstrate the effectiveness of the intervention. Critical Access Hospitals provide rural communities with access to healthcare. In addition, these hospitals provide economic benefit in the form of skilled jobs to rural communities across the United States. Hospitals everywhere are experiencing pressures due to increasing healthcare costs, an aging population, and a shortage of healthcare workers. These problems are often intensified for rural CAHs due to the demographics of the smaller, older communities that they serve. The proposed project will enable the business, Ocuvera, to modify its existing, promising solution to meet specific needs of CAHs. As a result, CAHs will be able to reduce specific healthcare costs related to falls and provide the same level of patient monitoring found at larger facilities elsewhere. These benefits will assist CAHs and their rural communities in continuing to exist, prosper, and become more self-sustaining."

They not only attract business and industry to the area, but they produce the educated labor force that is needed to sustain the economic growth of rural areas. The greatest source of a highly educated population in rural areas is native individuals who attended college locally or return home after completing their education. One of the cornerstones of a quality education is the ability to read and comprehend informational texts. School and career success depends on our ability to comprehend informational texts. Yet, nearly 44 million American adults cannot extract a single piece of information when they read an informational text if background knowledge is required. The results of the 2015 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) show that nearly 2/3 of American fourth-graders can only read at or below a proficient level, and when examined further, researchers found that on the 2009 NAEP test, fourth-grade students scored worse on informational texts than on literary passages--with students eligible for free lunch scoring the worst on informational texts. Because beginning readers are exposed to primarily literary texts, when students enter fourth grade and begin to read more content area informational texts, they have difficulty with comprehension. Comprehending informational texts requires a different set of strategies and skills than they have previously developed. The objective of StarrMatica&#39;s Customizable Informational Text System is to help teachers accomplish the four things that research indicates they must do to improve informational text comprehension: (a) increase students&#39; access to informational text, (b) increase the time students spend working with informational text in instructional activities, (c) explicitly teach comprehension strategies, and (d) create opportunities for students to use informational text for authentic purposes. StarrMatica will create a platform that houses K-5 science informational texts written by a children&#39;s author on the team to meet the Next Generation Science Standards. Teachers will have the ability to customize each text to teach specific text structures, print features, graphic aids, comprehension skills, and Common Core ELA standards at multiple Lexile reading levels. These customization options will allow teachers to differentiate comprehension instruction to meet the needs of all students and to support a variety of instructional objectives. The System will be designed to both teach and assess comprehension skills and will be tied to a classroom-management system that records student data. A pilot test and usability study followed by a feasibility study will provide qualitative and quantitative data before and after use of the System. Data will be analyzed and compared to determine change or gain in scores."

The GrainGoat successfully harvested, threshed, and tested the moisture content in several crop varieties.Since the innovative GrainGoat is the only handheld machine that can harvest, thresh and moisture sample on the spot it is imperative that extensive educational outreach be performed. The GrainGoat is not a ""better"" mousetrap it is the ""only"" mousetrap whose existence must be made known to all in the grain industry around the world. Problem:Feedback from researchers testing the GrainGoat concluded the weight must be reduced prior to commercialization.Additionally, not every seed variety could pass through the current screen structure.Solution:Working with a design for manufacture engineer we confirmed changing the current aluminum parts to injected molded plastic would allow for a significant weight reduction, material cost reduction, number of parts reduction and assembly time reduction. Our goal is to reduce the weight by 50% or more. A new design for the screening process is currently underway.  While working with the University of Nebraska Agronomy Department it was determined that a variant of the current model could easily be constructed from the same parts allowing researcher use in greenhouses, headrows, and test plots.After this Phase II research we will design the GrainGoat U model for university and seed researchers.Goals:Phase II financing will cover the screen changes,new CAD drawings and part design changes including the necessary plastic molds for injection molded parts. After field trials on the new design, the GrainGoat will be ready to go into full production. Investors have committed financial support for Phase III.Anticipated Results:Changes in design and manufacturing will produce a lighter weight machine with lower cost of production, faster assembly and rapid production of custom screens. Additional crop types will be compatible with the machine (i.e. soybeans, field peas, beans, rice etc.). The device (after successful Phase II research) will allow farmers to quickly sample any field, any time, to monitor moisture. University seed breeders will harvest test plots without cross contamination of varieties. Small grain farmers (369,000) in the U.S. will benefit from our device, as will small-scale foreign farmers using hand-harvesting methods. A worldwide market will be created. Manufacturing in the U.S. will generate jobs in rural areas."

For example, while corn (a hybrid crop) and soybeans (a self-pollinated crop) were planted on approximately the same land area in the U.S. in 2017, the total value of the corn hybrid seed industry was greater than 4x the value of the soybean seed industry. However, producing hybrid seed is expensive relative to self or open-pollinated crops. In some crops, such as soybeans and wheat, the biology of the plant is prohibitive to the economical production of hybrid seed, thus disabling the realization of the benefits of hybridity in these crops. Enabling a crop such as wheat to be produced as a hybrid would have an annual value exceeding several billion dollars.This project will develop methods to scale the preservation and storage of maize pollen and to enable on-demand use of the pollen. On-demand use of maize pollen in seed production will improve and enable hybrid seed production, thus improving agricultural productivity and food availability."

To achieve higher yields, plants need to be more energy efficient to complement the trend towards breeding and farming at higher plant densities. To date biotechnology has been very successful at weed and insect control products, but has not made much progress on developing more energy efficient plants due to the complex interactions of the many proteins and metabolic pathways involved. The large numbers of genes needed to improve complex traits affecting yield is beyond biotechnologies current capabilities. Our epigenetic technology provides a very different method to affect the expression of many genes in a useful and natural manner. Surprisingly, this epigenetic technology can be implemented without any changes in the DNA sequence of the plant.One of the fundamental biological processes increasing plant productivity is heterosis (increased yields from hybrid progeny relative to the yields of the parent plants), with hybrid corn as one of the most successful commercial examples. Although heterosis is phenotypically defined, its molecular basis is still debated and unproven. Our epigenetic technology phenotypically meets the definition of heterosis by increasing yields in progeny. Our working hypothesis is that epigenetics is an aspect of heterosis that has not been previously separable from genetics due to their concurrence on chromosomes. It is only with the ability to independently manipulate the epigenome in a biologically useful manner without changing DNA sequences that the role of the epigenome becomes apparent. Our proposal will advance our understanding of how epigenetics affects crop performance in field trials.Specifically in this proposal, we will develop improved methods for creating, identifying, and breeding epigenetic modifications for producing higher yielding tomato plants.The knowledge gained will advance our ability to manipulate the epigenome for increased yields in agriculture in multiple crops. A broad impact across multiple crops is supported by our findings of epigenetic-mediated yield increases in representative species in the Brassicaceae (mustards), Solanaceae [vegetables], Gramineae (cereals), and Leguminosae (beans), thereby providing examples in these important crops inboth dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plant examples.Epigenetics is the collective physical status of chromosomes including their chromosomal proteins and their posttranslational modifications, structural RNA, and DNA methylation components that affect transcription and splicing. The term &#39;epigenetics&#39; is often used to refer to cellular and developmental chromosomal events during a life cycle of an organism as well as transgenerational transmission of this &#39;non-DNA sequence&#39; information, with DNA methylation being the most studied aspect. In this proposal we are focused on the transgenerational aspect of epigenetics and use the term &#39;epigenetics&#39; in that context.A second feature of our epigenetic system is that it appears to require proceeding through one or more sexual reproduction steps. Meiosis appears to be a developmental stage at which epigenetic reprogramming occurs and at which decisions are made for which epigenetic modifications will be inherited.In particular, CHH methylation is partially removed and reprogramed via an elegant vegetative nucleus mechanism that transfers small RNAs from the vegetative cell to the sperm cell of the pollen to reestablish CHH methylation. CG and CHG methylation is predominantly maintained during meiosis and inherited in the progeny of plants."

From pharmaceuticals to aviation to defense, many industries now face a growing problem with maintaining visibility to the authentic products in their supply chain, while identifying black market and grey market products that could harm their customers and have serious impacts on national security. This project will build on interdisciplinary research from materials science, photonics and information technology to create an innovative new platform that connects physical supply chains with digital supply chains through the use of covert codes that are placed onto products. These codes are printed using nanoparticles that are only visible when exposed to a laser with very specific properties. The security platform that this research enables will provide U.S. industry with a robust new system for authenticating genuine products and maintaining visibility throughout the global supply chain. This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project develops a system designed to thwart counterfeiting. The system is based on 1) covert printed markings, carrying encoded information, that convert near infrared (NIR) excitation either to visible light or to shorter-wavelength NIR light, and 2) a proprietary reader-decoder system that is cyber-enabled to access secure data bases. The two major technical challenges addressed in this project both involve maximizing the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the system. The first challenge improves the long-term stability and up-converting nanoparticle payload-capacity of a novel, micro-emulsion (aqueous continuous-phase) ink. The second challenge creates micro- or nano-scale substrates that greatly amplify the up-conversion signal. Successfully overcoming these technical hurdles will significantly advance the readiness of the technology for commercialization and Phase II development. It is estimated that reaching the milestones specified within the specific research objectives will lead to a 250x enhancement of up-conversion intensity when using low excitation power densities. Such an enhancement would be transformational to the system and enable the use of lower laser powers in the reader/decoder device which in turn, would lower costs and greatly extend the utility of the system to, for example, a hand held, portable reader."

To protect valued assets, and still maintain the ships maneuverability and speed, the U.S. Navy requires lighter-weight armor. NanoCoatings, Inc. and South Dakota School of Mines & Technology propose a plastic-deformation mechanical treatment, friction-stir-processing (FSP), to enhance the performance of aluminum (Al)-alloy armor and encapsulate lightweight ceramic armor. The finer-grained FSP microstructure increases ductility and has been shown in preliminary ballistic tests to prevent penetration of an Al-alloy plate, compared to full-penetration of an equivalent areal-density Al plate. Our team proposes two unique concepts: 1) FSP of Al-alloy armor surfaces and 2) Encapsulation of alumina-ceramic tiles by FSP within an Al-armor package. Characterization will include: 1) x-radiography, 2) metallographic analysis, and 3) mechanical-property testing. Armor packages will be screened by ballistic tests, at the University of Dayton Research Institute, for comparison with baseline Al-armor. In the Phase I option, V50 ballistic tests will be conducted on a down-selected armor concept and a demonstration armor panel, showing form and fit, will be fabricated for trial integration with LCS.

Nuclear physic experiments require neutron detectors that are robust, compact, low-power, and have high-sensitivity, while stably operating in harsh environments, e.g., high-temperature and high radiation-dose. Wide-bandgap semiconductors will tolerate such environments. Furthermore, the devices must be insensitive to background radiation, while retaining high detection efficiency, preferably above 30%.
The objective of this project is to design and build for the first time a high- efficiency thermal-neutron detector made from wide-bandgap semiconductors. The detector will be based on the microstructured semiconductor neutron detector technology. The final deliverable for this project is a WB-MSND that has at least a thermal-neutron detection efficiency of 20% at an operating temperature of >100C. A secondary deliverable is a packaged WB-MSND with readout electronics that can operate within high-temperature and high-dose environments. In phase one, WB-MSNDs fabrication methodology, specifically micromachining these hard semiconductor materials and diode-contact fabrication, raw-material supply-chain trade study, and WB- MSND packaging for wide-range temperature operation (coefficient of thermal expansion can cause packaging issues) will be investigated. In phase two, further work will be pursued to fully develop the WB-MSND sensor and reduce its production-cost point, design and develop the readout electronics for the WB-MSND, and develop the technology to be arrayed in 1-cm2 two dimensional arrays. The new technology will deliver compact, high-efficiency, radiation hard, thermal-neutron detectors capable of real-time neutron measurements; such compact, solid-state semiconductor devices currently do not exist. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The scientific and commercial impact from the proposed research is expected to be significant. The results from this project will directly impact the quality of materials research and nuclear physics research planned for many nuclear science sites, e.g., ORNL SNS, Michigan State’s FRIB. Wide-bandgap microstructured semiconductor neutron detector technology will dramatically improve the life of neutron detectors that are placed in high-fluence areas, e.g., detectors at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are subject to fluences >1015 fast hadrons/cm2. Although this research is oriented towards the nuclear physics applications, its successful completion will have profound effects in many areas of the scientific and industrial community. A wide-bandgap microstructured semiconductor neutron detector sensor/array has direct applications in many other  areas of science and engineering, such as in high-resolution neutron radiography/tomography, in neutron diffraction studies for stress/strain measurements in materials with internal defects, and for surface diffraction studies of coatings and material fracturing,. The development of the novel detector designs proposed will benefit a wide spectrum of applications beyond the science of nuclear physics. Wide-band- gap semiconductors such as SiC, GaN, AlN, and maybe diamond, make these detector semiconductor materials attractive alternatives in applications in harsh environments by virtue of their lower operating voltage, faster charge-collection times compared with those of gas-filled detectors, and compact size."

In addition, many U.S. research reactors and industrial power nuclear-reactors would benefit from in-core neutron-flux monitoring. Here it is proposed to research advanced Micro-Pocket Fission Detector (MPFD) designs fabricated with alternative materials with VLSI methods for commercial production of the MPFD technology. A challenge for the project PI is to design a low-cost manufacturing method that allows for mass-production of these unique miniaturized fission chambers. The use of VLSI methods for MPFDs is unique to this project, and has not yet been conducted by any group nor for any prior or current project. The final deliverable for this project is a commercial-grade MPFD (C-MPFD) that has been designed and manufactured with commercialization as the primary focus. A secondary deliverable is a packaged C-MPFD with readout electronics for use with nuclear reactor instrumentation. The specific aims of this project are (1) to develop low-cost, easily-produced (VLSI techniques) variants of C-MPFDs in support of ongoing and future DOE-sponsored projects and (2) to understand better the signal pathway by a combination of testing and modeling. It is proposed to develop cost-effective and easily-produced variants of C-MPFDs and to study, in detail, their response, starting with the initiating (fission) event and ending with the discernible pulse and count. To address these issues, it is proposed to model, design, manufacture, and characterize C-MFPDs from alternative materials that can be mass-produced at low  cost. A two-phase plan is proposed to accomplish this effort. In Phase I, C-MPFD fabrication methodology, specifically applying VLSI fabrication techniques and micromachining these hard ceramic- materials, raw-material supply-chain trade study, and C-MPFD packaging for wide-range temperature operation will be investigated. In Phase II, further work will be pursued to fully develop the C-MPFD and reduce its production-cost point, develop the readout electronics for the C-MPFD. The scientific and commercial impact from the proposed research is expected to be significant. The results from this project will directly impact the quality of nuclear-reactor materials research. Successful completion of this project will deliver compact neutron-flux detectors capable of real-time in-core neutron-flux measurements at high-temperature, e.g., >100C, and high-dose radiation environment. Inclusively, frontend electronics will be developed to handle the signal amplification of the C-MPFD under high-temperature and radiation-dose environments, which has yet to be accomplished. Micro-pocket fission detectors are already well known within the DOE nuclear engineering community, with their use is beginning to play a significant role in many currently- funded projects, e.g., TREAT and DoD nuclear-power reactors. The commercial availability of these innovative sensors will accelerate the advancement of nuclear material testing; and hence, improving the quality of irradiation test programs. The outcome of this proposed work will be a design for devices that are inexpensive and easy to build in mass, and the impact will be the potential rapid deployment of these devices to the DOE and related communities."

In the United States, approximately 750,000 major cardiothoracic surgeries are performed each year. Each of these patients receives an average of two chest tubes to drain fluid and facilitate proper recovery, but approximately 36% of chest tubes become clogged. Patients with clogged chest tubes are more likely to experience post-surgical complications, which can result in life-threatening conditions and significantly increase the cost of care. To mitigate the risk of clogging, surgeons typically use large-bore chest tubes, which are more likely to be misplaced and to cause injury to surrounding organs. The novel device under development addresses these issues by preventing clog formation in small-bore chest tubes, thus maintaining proper fluid drainage. Anticipated impacts of the device include reduced time to ambulation and discharge, hospital readmissions, and nursing time. Commercially, the device addresses a $300 million initial market opportunity and has the potential to save the U.S. healthcare system approximately $1.7 billion per year from costs associated with preventable chest tube complications. The proposed project aims to develop a novel chest tube device to address the clinical need of maintaining proper fluid drainage after cardiothoracic surgery while enabling the use of small-bore chest tubes. Existing systems are prone to clogging, which can lead to life-threatening conditions, longer hospital stays, and increased costs. Building on the feasibility demonstrated in Phase I, the objective of this research is to continue development of the device and prepare for market entry; the research will be performed in three Aims. In the first Aim, critical aspects of usability and manufacturability will be addressed and incorporated into the final device design. In the second Aim, verification and validation activities will be performed to ensure the device meets all safety and functional requirements before clinical use. In the third Aim, the device?s supplemental ability to monitor lung healing status in patients undergoing thoracic surgery will be refined and tested on the benchtop and in an in vivo animal study."

However, the hurdle of operation safety in the form of avoiding airborne collisions must first be overcome.  UAVradars LLC is proposing a small, lightweight, and low-power radar system designed specifically to give small UAS (< 55 lbs) airborne collision-avoidance sensory capability.  Radar is ideally suited for this purpose due to its all-weather capability to provide accurate position and velocity data.  The proposed radar is based on previous R&D funded by NASA and performed at the University of Kansas from 2012 to 2014.  This effort resulted the successfully flight testing of a large scale proof-of-concept radar that was then miniaturized as an academic demonstrating of the potential reduction in size, weight and power (SWaP).  The SBIR Phase I focuses on overcoming critical factors specific to commercialization needs that were left unresolved.  These were 1) replace the bulky user laptop controller with a small Raspberry Pi 2 to allow the miniature radar system to be installed on a sUAS; 2) move the radar operations to the ISM band to avoid FCC licensing complications; and 3) implement radar transmit encoding to allow multiple radar systems to operate in the same area without cross jamming.  The successful complete of Phase I indicated the radar commercialization feasibility which leads into Phase II.  The objectives in Phase II is to create a flight tested prototype.  This involves 1) maximize radar hardware performance; 2) create a target detection and tracking algorithm; and 3) perform radar flight testing to validate its capability.  By completing these tasks, the Phase II miniature radar system will be proven as a disruptive technology for overcome key sense-and-avoid barriers in NASA?s efforts of integrating UAS in the National Airspace System (NAS)."

This manufacturing platform will utilize biologically derived sugar carbon-source and transform this carbon to higher value products via microbial fermentation. In contrast to the complex mixture of fatty acids currently produced in the oleochemical industry, the technology developed in this project will deliver a product stream containing simpler mixtures of monounsaturated fatty acids, which will eliminate the costly separation cost and be directly used to synthesize cost-efficient high-performance lubricants. Due to the improved lubrication performance of these molecules, this technology will potentially increase the energy efficiency of industrial and transportation machinery. By utilizing biological carbon feedstocks and producing bio-degradable products, this technology has the potential to reduce the environment footprint of the lubricant industry. More beneficial impacts are anticipated as we expand the application of monounsaturated fatty acids into other industries, such as surfactants and polymers. A large commercial potential of this technology has been identified in the lubricant market, currently valued at $123B per annum, and predicted to grow to $178B per annum in the next 5-years. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop technology that will deliver novel bio-based monounsaturated fatty acids that provide new chemical structures allowing innovations in lubricants not possible from petroleum-based raw materials. Based on successful development of bacterial strains capable of producing enriched monounsaturated fatty acids in the Phase I project, the Phase II project will further de-risk the technology and scale up the capability to produce sufficient quantities of monounsaturated fatty acids to be evaluated by potential customers. By optimizing and scaling up the fermentation process and developing the product extraction procedure, large quantity of the first generation product (55% enriched monounsaturated fatty acids) will be produced. It will be used to chemically synthesize high-performance lubricants (i.e., polyol esters), whose physical-chemical and tribological properties will be evaluated and provided to potential customers. In this project, metabolic engineering, system biology, and evolutionary strategies will be applied to further improve the strains for producing second generation products that are more enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids (70-80%) and achieve commercial viable technology metrics. The monounsaturated fatty acids are envisioned as platform chemicals for subsequent chemical conversion to numerous specialty chemicals that have applications in additional markets, such as surfactants and polymers."

The foundation for the proposed research is a no-heat-added solder paste made from liquid-metal particles that act like filled balloons, releasing a liquid metal when popped and then turning solid. Printed electronics offer potential for major manufacturing growth for the United States, because the device structure lends itself to being manufactured domestically, offering transportation advantages and overall lower costs of ownership. This technology may have applications in commercial flexible displays, wearable biomedical sensors, lightweight electronics for military equipment, and radio frequency identification tags for supply-chain connectivity. The development of the products enabled by this technology is expected to make U.S. citizens, institutions, military, and government agencies more efficient and effective with better inventory/waste tracking, biometrics collection, weight reduction, and object networking. Enabling new U.S. technologies creates market opportunities for the Internet of Things and telemedicine, as well as manufacturing opportunities to make electronics in the U.S., creating significant jobs, businesses, and tax revenue. This project focuses on developing unique undercooled metal microparticles for use in no-heat-added soldering of printed/flexible electronics. The research will decouple the heating from the joining of the metal?significantly lowering the processing temperature and thus preserving function for heat-sensitive electronics and substrates. The key to the innovation?an oxide encapsulating shell?prevents heterogeneous nucleation with a thin oxide shell and undercooling's enhancement on the micro- and nanoscale. It can be mechanically sheared or removed by chemical flux action to enable the liquid metal inside to first flow and coalesce, and to then solidify. The metal alloys can remain as liquids at room temperature for months. Research will increase the production yield and reliability of bismuth alloys that melt at 139°C to less brittle tin/silver/copper SnAgCu solder that melts at 217°C. Objectives are to 1) develop a material that can join/coat materials with solid metal without adding heat, 2) demonstrate the properties of the joint compared to conductive adhesives and traditional soldering, and 3) demonstrate a Wheatstone bridge and flexible Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) prototype device. Undercooled solders will be applied using flux strategies to make mechanically and electrically robust joints in an electronic device at room temperature."

It will enable many more patients with hearing loss to retain their hearing capacity much longer over their lifetimes. Hearing loss has a significant impact on physical and mental health, education, employment, and overall quality of life, and has been linked to an increased risk of dementia and feelings of depression, frustration, anxiety, and social isolation. 53 million people have severe-to-profound hearing loss and are eligible for traditional cochlear implants, but there are an additional 300 million with partial-to-moderate disabling hearing loss who are not eligible for a traditional implant and do not significantly benefit from other hearing assistive devices alone. The development of this technology will enable a much wider population of those with hearing loss to receive the benefits of a cochlear implant, using a novel wireless control and the added convenience of personalized hearing loss treatment regimens. This technology will also facilitate commercial opportunities for use of the implantable robotic system in other applications where an implantable electrode/wire requires precise and dynamic remote position adjustments. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design, develop and test a prototype of an implantable robotic system that wirelessly optimizes cochlear implant function and enables clinician adjustments as patient hearing deteriorates. Though traditional cochlear implants are used to treat severe-profound hearing loss, recent advances in hearing preservation technologies have allowed those with partial hearing loss, such as from noise exposure or aging, to benefit from cochlear implants. Unfortunately, clinical trials have found that more than 50% of these recipients experience continued hearing deterioration after cochlear implantation. Treatment options are limited to additional surgery for electrode replacement or living with limited hearing because the implants cannot be adjusted. This research is focused on developing an implantable robotic control system that will enable cochlear implants to dynamically adjust to post-surgical hearing decline without the need for additional surgery. In Phase I, individual components will be assembled into a functioning implantable robotic system that meets design and surgical size requirements to effectively move an electrode within a human cadaveric cochlea model. Anticipated results will include a prototype that has a novel micromechanical system for electrode adjustments, wireless communications for external control, and safe transcutaneous power."

The NGSS, which have been adopted by 17 states and the District of Columbia, place an emphasis on cross-cutting science, technology, math and engineering (STEM) concepts, but these concepts are often not yet incorporated in 9-12 grade curriculum. By leveraging the intrinsic appeal and intuitive nature of interactive media for learning, this project aims to address this gap, engendering student engagement with a learn-by-doing approach that incorporates problem solving and rewards student progress. Interactive media, specifically game-based learning, is beginning to gain momentum in classrooms as a complement to teacher-led instruction. The engagement of more young people in science is critical for our nation, both to create informed citizens and to properly prepare the next generation of skilled professionals. In addition to directly creating several jobs for skilled US citizens, the efforts of this project will contribute to a commercially viable mobile application for an educational technologies industry that is currently valued at $1.5 billion per annum and growing. This project will focus on radiant energy, including its physical attributes, how these attributes interact with the natural world (chemical, biological, geological, astronomical), and how radiant energy is harnessed for engineering and technological applications. This will lead students to think about real-world scenarios and learn how the natural connectivity of STEM will enable them to formulate a broad mental lattice which emphasizes the deep relationships within the biological, physical, and mathematical worlds. Light in the broad sense is electromagnetic radiant energy and includes radio waves, UV irradiation, visible light, gamma rays. Regardless of which type it is, the speed of light is the same, c, = 2.9979245Å~108 m s-1. This connection is often lost on students as there is no suitable way of teaching this in the classroom. In concert with the NGSS and the powerful potential of interactive applications in modeling complex systems, this project will give educators a tool to communicate these concepts using a hands-on approach. This innovation is based on evidence that active participation in learning can increase information retention rates by as much as 45% when compared to traditional lecture or audiovisual teaching techniques. In addition, the element of gamification further increases student engagement and sense of achievement."

In 1963, the USDA standardized electronic moisture sampling. Today, all U.S. grain terminals/elevators are required to use electronic moisture sampling machines that are calibrated and inspected to USDA standards.Problem: Efficiently obtaining a grain sample for moisture testing. Grain elevators charge dockage fees to farmers for grain that is too wet or too dry. Farmers must use full-sized combines to test moisture. This method requires hours of driving time, depreciation ($120/hr.), fuel, and labor expenses. A 2000-acre wheat farm missing the optimum harvest time loses $1600/day. Urban farmers and University test plots(50,000 head rows and 18,000 test plots in Nebraska alone) lack a cost effective method to harvest grain other than hand harvesting. The proposed miniaturized combine, a handheld, battery-powered device to rapidly harvest, thresh, and test moisture will eliminate the need to use large equipment for sampling.Objective: Collaboration with University of Nebraska Agronomy Department and Innovation Campus will test the accuracy and mechanical design on multiple varieties of grain. Field trials other than UNL plots, in major grain producing states (Texas through Montana) will be carried out simultaneously with test units operated by select farmers and custom grain harvesters. Educational outreach will be accomplished through UNL&#39;s Extension Educators, multiple state tradeshows, field demonstrations, and traditional marketing avenues aimed at grain growers.Anticipated Results: Our device will allow farmers to quickly sample any field, any time, to monitor moisture. University seed breeders will harvest test plots without cross contamination of varieties. Urban farmers will finally harvest backyard or small farm grains mechanically. Small grain farmers (500,000) in the U.S. will benefit by increased yields and profitability when using our device, as will small-scale foreign farmers currently using hand-harvesting methods. A worldwide market will be created. Manufacturing in the U.S. will generate jobs in rural areas."

For example, while corn (a hybrid crop) and soybeans (a self-pollinated crop) were planted on approximately the same land area in the U.S. in 2015, the total value of the corn hybrid seed industry was greater than 4x the value of the soybean seed industry. However, producing hybrid seed is expensive relative to self or open-pollinated crops. In some crops, such as soybeans and wheat, the biology of the plant is prohibitive to the economical production of hybrid seed, thus disabling the realization of the benefits of hybridity in these crops. Enabling a crop such as wheat to be produced as a hybrid would have an annual value exceeding several billion dollars.This project will develop methodsto extend the viability of pollen and enable on-demand use of the pollen.

It is estimated that it costs the Gulf Coast fishing industry approximately $82 million per year. This issue is caused by misplaced nutrients. This project uses an algae-based treatment system to remove nutrients from a place they are unwanted (in wastewater) and convert them into a product (fertilizer) that can be placed where they are wanted. The fertilizer produced in this project is considered a slow-release fertilizer capable of reducing nutrient runoff from fields, gardens, and lawns, which are major contributors of nutrients in our natural waterbodies.Algal-based treatment is considered a ""green,"" sustainable treatment platform capable of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, while removing pollutants from wastewater. Currently, algal treatment systems are not feasible due to the high cost of operation. Our company recently invented the revolving algal biofilm (RAB) system, a game changing technology capable of drastically decreasing the cost of algal treatment.In this study we will evaluate nutrient the removal capacity of our pilot-scale RAB treatment system at industrial wastewater producers. The algae produced during treatment will be converted into a slow-release fertilizer via a pelletization process. This fertilizer will be evaluated for its nutrient release properties to determine its value as a slow-release, organic fertilizer. Lastly, the costs and energy inputs to produce an algal-based fertilizer will be assessed. Cumulatively this project will validate both the RAB system and the pelletization process as a viable option for treating nutrients in the $183 billion wastewater treatment market."

Nearly 200 million children worldwide suffer from malnutrition with the World Health Organization estimating that 54% of child mortality is the result of malnutrition (Shockley, 2014). With land and water use already stressed with food production (70% of all agricultural land and 30% of total land is used to raise livestock), along with the measured effect of animal production on greenhouse gas emissions and ammonia waste, another viable, sustainable, and scalable source of nutrient rich food must be explored to meet the rising food demand and address the current global rates of malnutrition (Shockley, 2014). Bugeater Labs wants to introduce a protein source that is more sustainable than today&#39;s top national protein sources with insect protein. While utilizing insects for food is not a new concept, one of the main challenges to brodar use of insects as a major human food source throughout the world, especially in the United States and Europe, is meeting the challenge of ""how to turn insects into safe, healthy, and tasty food products. (Shockley, 2014)."" Creating widespread acceptance, innovation in products, and ensuring high value nutrients, are essential to meeting the growing food demand over the next 35 years. The main methods for this project will be trial and error. Bugeater Labs will be running extrusion trials (production trials) of insect rice and pasta with insect. Each product created will be tasted, cooked, and have nutritional analysis ran on them to find the best overall product for consumers. Once 2-3 options are decided a sensory evaluation will be done to see any consumer suggestions and to find the best product. We will conduct economic feasibility research through out the process to asure this product is cost effective for both the company and consumers. In the end it is expected to have created a product that is acceptable for most consumers and have increased nutrition content over non-insect fortified competitors. Bugeater Labs&#39; goal is to increase consumption of insect-based products in an effort to meet the growing population&#39;s food demands on limited resources while growing the insect industry to drive down costs and speed adoption. The innovation in our project is creating insect products that mimic traditional staple foods and provide high-value nutrients for widespread adoption in the market. By incorporating insects into traditional staple foods, we believe will see acceptance grow faster and allow for the development of more insect based food products. This will create a new protein source that can address some food security issues and lessen the environmental impact of other sources."

Currently there is no method for real-time classification of beef by tenderness. Current beef marketing is based on USDA quality grades (Prime, Choice, and Select). Therefore, the beef industry needs an integrated system that can simultaneously predict beef tenderness and also USDA grades. In the Phase I study, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of predicting beef tenderness and USDA grades with a multispectral imaging system. However, in order to commercialize our technology, we need to (1) develop, refine, and integrate functionality for predicting USDA grades concurrent with beef tenderness, (2) evaluate accuracy and repeatability of the system with a large dataset, and (3) increase the prediction speed of the system. The overall goal of this Phase II proposal is to make the multispectral imaging system used in Phase I ready for commercial use.Meat packers are anxious to sort beef by tenderness because consumers are willing to pay a premium for steaks that are guaranteed tender. All of the major packers have expressed interest in a service to classify beef for tenderness. Economists estimate the domestic economic value of a USDA certified tender beef program to be as much as $760 million per year. Capturing a small portion of this value using the proposed technology would return annual revenue of $28 million. International potential would magnify this effect. This project is expected to enhance economic opportunities for cattle producers in rural America and processors by improving assessment of beef product quality to meet consumer expectations."

Proposed Approach to a Solution: Successful solids handling will be achieved primarily through pneumatic control. Using robust blowers, duct size variation, and hydro cones, as well as applied temperature and pressure, the system controls the velocity of the feedstock solids to create the conditions to fractionation and coproduct separation prior to fermentation. The continuous handling of the solids can be adjusted through numerous assemblies creating a non-limiting through-stock allowing biochemical scenarios for production of cellulosic ethanol, fast pyrolysis and hydro treating bio-oil pathways. Scientific laboratories will be utilized for analysis. Certified Public Accounts specializing in the Ethanol Industry will provide economic modeling. Phase 1 Technical Objective: The feasibility of the system will be established through design, fabrication, and testing of various blower speeds, duct sizing and venturi models in our shop. From these models evaluation of economy and coproducts will determine feasible value of fractionated solids for an ethanol plant. The model will demonstrate that fractionation and separation of corn pre-fermentation coproducts such as Germ will be suitable for food grade oil and Fiber to create more cellulosic biofuel options. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed system will not challenge the incumbent. The commercial application benefits existing ethanol plants that are not currently fractionating or that are fractionating with older equipment in need of updating to a more productive system with increased energy efficiency. The proposed system is projected to provide an operating ethanol plant with additional values a result of several factors:
Fractionation removes inhibiting compounds resulting in faster fermentation time and more
efficient conversions
Decreased natural gas usage
Higher prices for fractionation co-products
Creates options for cellulosic biofuels from fiber
Remove fiber, pretreat, add back into starch fermentation, or
Separate cellulosic conversion
EPA Pathways exist for corn fiber to cellulosic biofuels
We have identified fractionation competition:
Corn wet mill products using water
This SBIR project reduces plant water consumption 18% per bushel
This technology has the potential to be adapted to other feedstocks such as Class B Municipal Sludge,
eggshell and membrane separation, and grease cake (food waste) to animal feed.

remains prevalent  and can affect a broad range of everyday activities  An effective brief cognitive screen that
could be implemented in busy HIV clinics  where clinicians have limited time to provide care for patients with
complex medical  psychiatric  and cognitive conditions  has the potential to significantly impact patient care  in
terms of both identifying patients who may warrant additional treatment considerations as well as the potential
to track changes in cognition over time  Unfortunately  current brief cognitive screens have lacked sensitivity to
the generally mild and mild to moderate deficits associated with modern HAND  Phase I saw the development
of a brief  iPad based cognitive screening tool that could be self administered  and exhibited good validity
 relative to a gold standard neuropsychological  NP  test battery  and test retest reliability  The   test
combination  taking only   minutes to complete  produced very good classification accuracy  with sensitivity

 The aims of Phase II are to    enhance the technical capabilities and usability of the iPad based cognitive
screen for both patients and clinicians     improve the clinical relevance of the iPad based cognitive screening
tool  and    establish the clinical utility of the revised tool 
 To accomplish these aims  we will improve the existing interface by creating a revised dashboard based
upon input from senior clinicians and adapt it to present results in a user friendly and easily interpretable

This will allow small-scale farmers to invest in other farmers to diversify their operations, creating a more reliable income stream and consequently increasing the stability and resilience of small farms, which will greatly benefit the rural economy. Incentivizing these farmers to upload data to improve projection accuracy will result in more robust datasets that can be used to compare and optimize farming practices. The micro-consortia that will be formed will reduce barriers to entry in the agricultural sector by facilitating remote transactions, contracts, and management. This platform could eventually help farmers in developing countries produce agricultural goods with the financial help and expertise of more established farms in the developed world. By increasing participation in agriculture and improving upon current farming practices around the world, this platform can help feed the world's growing population for years to come. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to generate better agricultural decision making and implementation tools by improving upon existing data sets. Massive amounts of data are being collected by farming operations, but that data is often difficult to manage. This project can help farmers utilize this information by providing visual tools to make advanced data analysis and decision-making more intuitive and user-friendly. The feasibility depends on developing an accurate decision support system as well as providing actionable recommendations to incentivize the use of the tools. The goal of the project is to develop the main simulation tool for a decision support platform, along with easy-to-understand visualizations of different investment projections and their impact on income. Finally, users will be given the ability to act upon the recommendations from the analysis immediately and directly from the analysis platform."

Unlike the    Ir radiation source used in existing radiotherapy approaches     Gd can be partially shielded 
which enables the radiation source to emit a deliberately non symmetric dose distribution  This effectively
directs radiation away from sensitive  healthy tissues and into tumor tissue  and therefore offers several
advantages over existing treatment techniques  Our preliminary data indicate RSBT stands to become the
prostate cancer treatment with the lowest incidence of resulting sexual dysfunction  gastro intestinal  and
genitourinary toxicity due to its ability to reduce urethral  rectal  and bladder dose relative to conventional
treatments  We hypothesize RSBT will further enable prostate cancer dose escalation beyond conventional
methods  without increasing dose to healthy tissues  thus improving metastasis free tumor control at     years
post treatment  RSBT may also reduce the number of treatment sessions patients need compared to current
therapies  We have already developed concept models of several sub components of the prostate RSBT
system to prove each component can be successfully constructed for eventual integration into a full RSBT
prototype system  Here we will demonstrate feasibility of the RSBT approach and its advantages over existing
treatments  We will develop a prototype of the needle catheter source capable of delivering RSBT  We will
develop RSBT apparatus functionality to enable the control and monitoring of the positioning of single catheter
with using a simple moving template design that converts translational template motion to rotational catheter
motion  We will develop a multiple catheter control system by integrate the previously developed components
into a complete RSBT prototype and validate the complete system by dose measurement  Successful
completion of these aims will demonstrate the feasibility and commercial potential of the RSBT approach 
Ultimately  this work will result in an improved  clinically available prostate cancer treatment  Our technology

In the United States, approximately 750,000 major cardiothoracic surgeries are performed each year. These patients receive at least one chest tube to drain fluid and facilitate proper healing, but approximately 36% of chest tubes become clogged. Patients with clogged chest tubes are more likely to experience post-surgical complications, which can result in life-threatening conditions and significantly increase the cost of care. To mitigate the risk of clogging, surgeons typically use large-bore chest tubes, which are more likely to be misplaced and to cause injury to surrounding organs. The novel device under development addresses these issues by preventing clog formation in small-bore chest tubes, thus maintaining proper fluid drainage. Anticipated impacts of the device include reduced time to ambulation and discharge, hospital readmissions, and nursing time. Commercially, the device addresses a $300 million initial market opportunity and has the potential to save the U.S. healthcare system approximately $1.7 billion per year from costs associated with preventable chest tube complications. The proposed project aims to develop a novel chest tube device to solve the clinical need of maintaining proper fluid drainage after cardiothoracic surgery while enabling the use of small-bore chest tubes. Existing systems are prone to clogging, which can lead to life-threatening conditions, longer hospital stays, and increased costs. The objective of this research is to continue device development and demonstrate statistically significant superiority in drainage effectiveness over standard large-bore chest tubes in vivo. In this project, the ability of the device to maintain continuous, clog-free fluid drainage in small-bore chest tubes will be assessed in a benchtop simulation model, while certain design characteristics are optimized. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the device will be demonstrated under normal and challenged conditions in an animal model and compared against the performance of standard large-bore chest tubes. Successful conclusion of this effort will result in an optimized version of the device that is suitable for use in clinical studies, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the device in humans."

However, when an unexpected failure occurs, it can introduce significant delays in not only the specific aircraft""s maintenance, but of the entire network of systems. 21st Century Systems, Inc. (21CSi) is in the position to answer this challenge with a concept called Reactive Aircraft Maintenance System via Evolutionary Scheduling (RAMSES). This project""s namesake was known for his organizing ability and capacity to move large projects along. Just as Ramses utilized the best technology of his day, RAMSES uses powerful algorithms to optimize the maintenance network in the face of unforeseen failures. The base optimization engine is an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), which provides the ability to operate under the uncertainty an unforeseen failure creates through the use of Subjective Logic. This enables the algorithm to optimally select a maintenance plan that deals directly with the materials, personnel, and facility, yet allow the algorithm to handle the uncertainty of the availability of each. The result is a shop floor capable of effectively handling any unforeseen event. And, with 21CSi""s sustained superlative commercialization index, we are the right company at the right time to improve ALC operations.  BENEFIT:  The RAMSES concept will have direct benefit to both the military aircraft depot as well as commercial aircraft depots. RAMSES provides a method to optimally reschedule the entire depot if an unforeseen event occurs that may cause major disruptions in the work flow. Behind the scenes, RAMSES is able to interlink all the components and activities at the depot using an evidential reasoning technology, the Evidential Reasoning Network (ERN). ERN technology allows us to describe the effects an unforeseen event would have on the components of the depot in terms of added or reduced delay. By incorporating uncertainty directly into the calculations, we are able to form conditional bounds on the effect. The EA then solves the optimization problem using these bounds. Therefore, when an unexpected event occurs, RAMSES sends out the rescheduling plan directly to the same system that the technicians are currently using. RAMSES will even develop contingency plans in the case of compound or cascading events. As far as the technician is concerned, the result is simply a change in the schedule. However, the depot supervisor, overseeing the entire operation, will notice how RAMSES maneuvers the depot floor to account for the unexpected event whilst maintaining the highest throughput possible given the anomaly. We also see this technology expanding beyond aircraft. Almost all fleet type operations have some form of maintenance shop. Land, sea, and air all require their vehicles to be periodically serviced to maintain the performance necessary for operational success. RAMSES is able to optimize scheduling from the smallest to the largest operations. The innovative ERN method to describe the relationships of the components and vehicles in the shop can be scaled for any size operation. The result is an integrated tool that saves time in a situation that usually only costs time and resources."

These wildlife reservoirs represent a potential threat to public health, serving as a continuous and difficult to eradicate source of infection for zoonotic diseases, but may also represent a significant economic threat to US agriculture.    In particular, wild ruminants including white-tail deer may harbor vector-borne infectious diseases that can directly impact US Cattle and Sheep operations.  Medgene Labs focuses on the development of novel subunit vaccine formulations to address these critical diseases that may affect both public health and US agricultural animals.  Subunit vaccines have the advantage of being highly stable and safe from potential reversion to virulence, supporting strong protective immune responses without the potential for contributing to new outbreaks through combination with wild-type agents. Furthermore, these strategies are ideally suited to the development of immune responses to effectively differentiate vaccinated from infected animals (DIVA approach).   Our current development efforts have defined highly efficacious, DIVA-compatible vaccine formulation directed against Rift Valley Fever Virus, and a focus of this proposal is to define an efficacious oral vaccine. This proposal will leverage the existing strength that Medgene Labs brings to the generation of highly effective and safe vaccine strategies directed against RVFV and other orbiviruses of national interest to define appropriate delivery systems for oral vaccination of wildlife.  Following initial characterization of these oral formulations in a well-established sheep model, we will proceed directly in Phase II to define efficacy in target domestic and wild cervid populations."

Cellular automata are massively parallel, regularly connected and allow only local data exchanges between cells. Cellular automata computation models map perfectly to modern many-core computing hardware.  Opportunities have arrived to take advantage of the massively parallel nature of cellular automata to facilitate the implementation of efficient graph computations on these hardware. Graphs represent complex relations of irregularly connected entities. Parallelizing graph algorithms requires partitioning the graph traversals into concurrently running computing threads, which is notoriously difficult. Since cellular automata cells concurrent execute their program on neighboring cells, mapping graphs to cellular automata space can provide efficient solutions. In this project, we propose using cellular automata as the intermediate layer to translate graph computations to many-core hardware. This entails 3 main objectives: to optimally layout any complex graphs to cellular automata space, to develop graph computation solutions on cellular automata, and to implement these solutions on many-core hardware. When the Phase I project is completed, there is a great chance that we can improve the capability of current graph analysis software, bringing massively parallel computing on graphs to the general public."

In some cases, LEOs did not recognize or were not aware of health conditions and/or associated behaviors of these individuals. Negative outcomes may have been avoided if the individual’s caregiver, parent, or guardian were quickly involved and able to serve as the individual’s advocate. IAS provides LEOs with up-to-date, real-time alerts about the medical conditions of individuals that they confront, and enables officers to contact caregivers immediately. The system also simultaneously alerts caregivers about an incident, enabling the caregiver to intervene promptly. During Phase I, the system is tested with normative individuals from an autism support group, a local LE agency, and parents/caregivers to gather user feedback. The system allows for improved safety of individuals with disabilities (i.e., autism, Alzheimer’s and other cognitive/behavioral disorders) in independent living, work, and learning environments.

However, the hurdle of operation safety in the form of avoiding airborne collisions must first be overcome.  Radar is ideally suited for this purpose due to their all weather capability to provide accurate position and velocity data.  UAVradars LLC is proposing a small, lightweight, and low-power radar system designed specifically to give small UAS (UAS < 50 lbs) airborne situation awareness capability.  The proposed radar is based on previous R&D funded by NASA LEARN at the University of Kansas from 2012 &#150; 2014.  This effort resulted in a brassboard proof-of-concept radar system that was successfully flight tested onboard a Cessna 172.  The brassboard system was then miniaturized demonstrating the feasibility of reducing its size, weight and power consumption.  The proposed SBIR objectives focuses on three technical objectives needed to commercialize this radar.  Objective 1 is to develop a FPGA controller/processor that can replace the user laptop allowing UAS flight testing in phase II. Objective 2 is to move the radar operation to the ISM band to avoid FCC complications (supporting NASA's goal to simplify certification needs) and to adaptively allocate the radar operating frequency to maximize detection performance.  Objective 3 is to encode each radar's transmit with a random phase allowing multiple radar carrying UASs to operate within the same area without cross-jamming one another.  By performing these tasks, the resulting phase I radar system will meet NASA's need for UAS technology that would allow humans to safely operate multiple UAS with minimal oversight, and provide the foundation for UAS external perception/cognition and multi-vehicle cooperation.  Phase I will result in simulation, hardware in the loop testing, and analysis of all three objectives leveraging the existing prototype miniature radar system."

Unfortunately, themolecular basis of heterosis is still unproven, and tools for specifically manipulating andincreasing heterotic combining ability are lacking. This proposal is not about heterosis: rather itis focused on a new method of altering the epigenome that produces plants that have heterosislike responses in plants. Specifically, the plants produced by this new method have increased yields and more heat tolerance.Our methods are a new combination of genetics and plant breeding steps that modify the epigenome for improved plant yields. The initial steps are to evaluate several different methods for achieving this, and the subsequent part of the project are to field evaluate the plants produced. The expected benefits are higher yielding plants that are also more heat tolerant. Higher yields imply more efficient use of water to achieve these yields, and water is an increasingly valuable and limited resource.

Currently there is no method for real-time classification of beef by tenderness. The overall objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of a multispectral image acquisition system for real-time forecasting of beef tenderness (forecast 14-day tenderness from 2-day images). We have demonstrated that hyperspectral imaging (with 91 wavelength bands) can forecast beef tenderness with high accuracy. However, the image capture time and the analysis of the massive amounts of hyperspectral image data make this technology unrealistic for real-time implementation. To make this technology commercially feasible, we have identified and validated eight key wavelength bands that are central to beef tenderness forecasting. A multispectral imaging system capable of rapidly acquiring the key wavelength bands on moving beef carcasses will be tested for forecasting beef tenderness. These efforts will lead to a rapid and accurate multispectral imaging technology for real-time tenderness forecasting in commercial beef packing plants.Meat packers are anxious to sort beef by tenderness because consumers are willing to pay a premium for steaks that are guaranteed tender. All of the major packers have expressed interest in a service to classify beef for tenderness. Economists estimate the domestic economic value of a USDA certified tender beef program to be as much as $760 million per year. Capturing 5% of this value using the proposed technology would return an annual revenue of $38 million. International potential would magnify this effect. This project is expected to enhance economic opportunities for cattle producers in rural America and processors by improving assessment of beef product quality to meet consumer expectations."

Each tool combines remotely-sensed, high-resolution digital elevation models and newly developed hydrologic algorithms with long standing soil-loss modeling principles. The results are two-dimensional, distributed soil loss predictions for sheet, rill, and ephemeral gully erosion. Agren has incorporated the RUSLER methodology and RUSLE2 modeling engine as the core technologies underlying their SoilCalculator tool. With an easy to use interface and intuitive, captivating map-based outputs, SoilCalculator has the potential to revolutionize soil conservation planning. However, long runtimes, excessive use of server resources, and computational issues with the legacy RUSLE2 modeling make it impossible to offer SoilCalculator as a commercially viable product.Progress made during Phase I SBIR indicates scaling SoilCalculator is technically feasible and attainable in the near-term. Code changes internal to the RUSLE2 model have reduced runtimes by 100. This, along with a prototype parallel computing architecture, shows promise to further increase computational efficiency and result in reliable, cost-effective simulations.The objective of Agren&#39;s Phase II work is to continue to overcome the technical and scientific limitations of offering a full-suite of erosion prediction services using the core science and modeling framework of RUSLE2. Research questions include:How are proposed modifications to the distributed SoilCalculator framework and RUSLER DLL related to scalability and compute time?Can these modifications result in a tool that meets end-user requirements for delivery via a cloud-based precision ag platform?Can UAV-collected photogrammetry yield elevation models compare to proven ground-collection methods for measuring small changes in ephemeral gullies?What is the relationship of EphGEE model results to measured values of sediment loss in ephemeral gullies in different geographic areas and under different management systems? How can EphGEE be configured to improve correlation with measured values?How can the RUSLER science and modeling framework be leveraged to create added saleable value for SoilCalculator?The proposed project expands the research, development and validation of models for distributed erosion modeling, which are substantial scientific improvements over existing modeling tools.

However, sorghum lags behind other crops in making progress in breeding for increased yield and improved traits. Heartland Plant Innovations is developing a robust system for producing and utilizing Sorghum Doubled Haploids (SDHs), a non-transgenic approach that greatly accelerates plant breeding. DH breeding systems are widely used in crops such as corn, but totally lacking for sorghum. Developing a SDH production system will offer a quicker route to new, improved hybrids with increased yields for farmers. In Phase I, HPI discovered a Haploid Inducing Pollinator (HIP1) that induces formation of viable haploid seeds in diverse lines of sorghum. Working with collaborators, HPI will use HIP1 to develop and implement an efficient pilot scale SDH system for breeding and genetics. This will be accomplished through research and development focused on the following objectives: 1) Confirm and characterize haploid-inducing pollinators identified during Phase I, determine the genetic basis for haploid induction by these lines and improve their performance; 2) Plan and execute a 2nd year of field trials to expand the hunt for useful pollinators; 3) Develop and integrate components of a commercial SDH breeding system, including seed sorting and chromosome doubling; 4) Develop a plan for marketing HPI&#39;s SDH breeding system to customers.Sorghum breeders who are working to deliver new inbreds and hybrids to farmers would greatly benefit from incorporating SDH lines into their programs. SDH lines could be used to accelerate traditional breeding, or to rapidly introgress high-value traits for resistance to diseases, insects or abiotic stress. Success with the proposed sorghum DH research will permit expansion of HPI&#39;s customer base to include sorghum breeders around the world. HPI expects to market production of SDHs on demand, or to partner with others in making DH technology available for customers to use."
RAINBOW ORGANIC FARMS CO,Good Natured Food Campus- An Economic and Cultural Engine for the Northside Regeneration Plan,Department of Agriculture,,Phase II,SBIR,2015-04370,2015-33610-24234,09-17-2015,,,2015,812,2015,"$332,275.00 ",828044891,N,N,N,5,,1976 55TH ST,,Bronson,KS,66716-0000,Diana Endicott ,President,(913) 636-9989,allnatural@ckt.net,Diana Endicott ,President,(913) 636-9989,allnatural@ckt.net,,,,Farms Food Campus Regeneration Missouri Kansas Distribution Aggregation Value-Added,"Rainbow Organic Farms Co., DBA Good Natured Family Farms, proposes to establish The Good Natured Food Campus - a local food aggregator, wholesale distributor and value-added facility of locally-grown food from small/mid-sized farms, to be located in the heart of the Northside Regeneration Plan Community in North St. Louis, MO.The Food Campus will address the fresh-food needs of a vulnerable population in an impoverished food desert, and incentivize local small and mid-sized farmers to grow and sell more products locally - thereby strengthening the sustainability of the local farming community.The City of St Louis is ranked as one of the nation&#39;s leading areas in critical food shortage - it is nearly impossible for the underserved community of North St. Louis to access local, healthy, and affordable food; 25.7% of households with children are struggling with food security and hunger issues daily.On the other hand, in 2010, Missouri ranked second in the country for number of farms (108,000). However, the availability of locally produced fresh foods in Missouri is limited due to the lack of production of fresh market fruit and vegetables and a scarcity of facilities able to clean, process, repack, and market fresh foods. Another compelling reason for the unavailability of locally produced fresh foods in Missouri is that local food producers face market-access challenges, such as:SupplyMost farmers don&#39;t grow enough to consistently or adequately supply larger distribution channelsMost farmers are unable to compete with agri-businessInsuranceMost farmers can&#39;t afford to meet costly liability requirements of food merchandising and food service purchasersPackagingRequirements often too costly and sometimes too difficult to meet on a small farm or at a small enterpriseLogisticsShipping to many customers is not efficient or economicalThe Good Natured Food Campus, along with the recruitment and mentoring of local farmers into a large Farmer Alliance network will help to negate these obstacles and would enable even the smaller farmers to participate in selling their products. Local small/mid-sized farmers will have increased income through new revenue streams through membership in the Farmers Alliance.The Farmers Alliance will enable farmers to consolidate sales, packing and transportation, incur lower risks with higher profits - and will become GAP Certified (Good Agricultural Practices) which will enable them to pursue sales to large grocers. GAP Certification is a requirement of grocers, but many farmers are in the dark on how to proceed with this program. The Food Campus and the Farmers Alliance will mentor farmers to get them up to speed to meet the GAP requirements, ensure food safety, and promote and encourage sustainability of local farm enterprises.The outcome of including more farmers in the Good Natured Family Farms Alliance is increased income for sustainable farms, increased land value, beginner farmers joining the farming industry, and local, fresh food availability will thwart natural and man-made disasters. Growth in the local foods industry could support more young people who stay on the farm - or come back to the farm after college - to carry on the family business.The vulnerable, underserved population in the inner-city of North St. Louis is the other targeted audience group that the Food Campus will assist. This area is impoverished and lacks any resource for fresh, local food. The Food Campus will be established in the middle of this area and will focus on wholesale food distribution and EBT food programs that will help stretch the food dollar of the families who rely on food assistance. Missouri Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) is the method by which households receive and use Food Stamp benefits. According to the USDA, the percentage of EBT users in St. Louis City is 36%, compared to 14.3% of Americans nationwide who relied on food stamps in March, 2011.The Food Campus will build strategic community"

In the cold spray process, powder particles are accelerated by a supersonic gas jet at a temperature lower than the melting point of the material, resulting in the formation of a metallurgically-bonded coating from particles in the solid state. Because the temperatures of the cold spray process are significantly lower than other thermal spray processes, surfaces can be easily repaired without overheating or overaging the substrate materials. The use of high-pressure cold spray (>500 psi) has been shown to be capable of producing coatings of superior mechanical strength and adhesion (>10 ksi), making it suitable for some structural applications. Furthermore, the cold spray coating can be specifically tailored to meet the corrosion requirements of the components, through an understanding of the corrosion potentials of the substrate and coating. In this way, coatings of a neutral, anodic, or even a cathodic nature can be designed and applied."

The feasibility of the deep borehole option relies upon designing and constructing an effective seal within the borehole that ensures the waste package does not communicate through the borehole itself with the shallow subsurface and biosphere for thousands of years. Recent work has suggested that encapsulating the waste in melted rock will create a seal that is more reliable and lasts longer than conventional sealing materials, such as cement and bentonite. The  proposed project consists of designing a  remote, electrical rock  melt borehole sealing system and testing the  performance of the  system both  in a laboratory and  then with field  tests in an  underground environment (the Sanford Underground Research Facility [SURF]), which is  located at the former Homestake Gold  Mine  in  western South Dakota). Phase I of the project evaluated the overall feasibility of the rock melt sealing concept by incorporating laboratory testing and numerical modeling to develop a preliminary design of a downhole heater. Phase I also  estimated costs  for in  situ field  testing at the SURF and indicated that  the necessary field   evaluation  could   be  completed within  a  reasonable budget. The major tasks envisaged for the Phase II Work Plan consist of the following:  1.   Design and construct the initial prototype heater  2.   Perform laboratory-scale prototype testing  3.   Prepare the SURF field experiment site  4.   Perform field-scale rock melt testing within the SURF  5.   Conduct a mine-back investigation to access the borehole seal  6.   Design a full-scale heater for use in the deep borehole environment.  In   situ  melting experiments  performed at  the  SURF provide a  unique  opportunity  to evaluate the rock  melt seal  system in  a  deep  underground environment and perform a  mine- back  excavation and forensic analysis, which is necessary to build confidence in the system.

The  demonstration of a  successful design rock  melt borehole sealing system has  the  potential  to significantly contribute to the  U.S. Department of Energy Used  Fuel Disposition Campaign and  help  address an  issue of national (and international)  importance. Confidence in a more robust sealing method is expected to be advantageous for the consent-based approach to siting waste facilities."

This new technology optimizes epigenetic information in a plant to stimulate plant growth and vigor in a manner similar to hybrid plant vigor. This proposal seeks to combine this new method with traditional hybrids to increase plant yields. It is likely that insights into the epigenetic mechanisms involved in plants improved by this method will advance the understanding of the long-standing mystery of how heterosis increases yields in hybrid plants. Commercially, higher yielding crops are more profitable to farmers and seed producers, thereby increasing profitability throughout the rural agricultural economies. More importantly, these crops are better for the environment as they require less land, water, fuel, and fertilizer than traditional crops for equivalent yields. This STTR Phase I project proposes to test the hypothesis that the proposed epigenetic technology can increase yields in hybrid corn. The project's goal is to measure yields in field tests with the appropriate epigenetically improved hybrids to test this hypothesis. The project's objectives are to develop two sets of epigenetically modified corn plants to be crossed to heterotic parent plants for hybrid testing. One population will utilize a naturally occurring mutant in the Msh1 gene. The second population will be developed with RNAi silencing methods. Both populations will be screened for optimal phenotypic and molecular responses. Selected individual plants will be advanced for crossing in a winter nursery to produce hybrid seed.

In 2014, there were no fewer than 70 reported cases of injury or death in confined agricultural spaces. Fifty-four percent were related to entrapments, but there are other incidents including asphyxiations, entanglements, falls, and fires. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulates the workplace safety procedures surrounding commercial grain bin use in the United States. However, in 2010 alone, OSHA performed 300 site inspections of commercial properties and reported finding nearly 75% of the workers in violation of their regulations which prohibit a worker entering a grain bin while grain is being emptied or moved into or out of the bin. Current regulations require a permit each time a worker enters a bin unless the employer is present during the entire entry operation. Our major goal is to prevent injuries and deaths caused by sweep auger operation, including equipment entanglement or grain entrapment and resulting suffocation, through the development of a robot for safer sweep auger assistance that eliminates the need for workers to enter grain bins to keep bin sweeps operating properly. Our approach to reduce risk, improve safety, and help ensure compliance with increasingly strict safety regulations involving sweep auger operations is the development of a robot for safer sweep auger assistance. The remotely-controlled, battery-powered robot eliminates the need for commercial grain storage workers or farmers to enter large grain storage bins to assist in completing the dangerous task of emptying grain from the bottom of the bin. The research will develop the robot, and evaluate its use and ability to promote safer common practices among grain production workers. BinMaster, a division of Garner Industries, is collaborating with robotic experts at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to develop the robot and conduct initial field tests. Observation of worker practices with and without the assistance of the robot will be documented and analyzed to determine the impact of the robot on worker safety. Upon commercialization, the robot will be manufactured by BinMaster and marketed to both commercial and on-farm grain storage facilities. Our ultimate goals and anticipated long-term impact of the development and subsequent commercialization of a robot for safer sweep auger operation include a decrease in the number of injuries and deaths resulting from grain bin entry, as well as improved compliance with federal regulations."

However, steel components used in the combustors suffer from corrosion degradation due to the aggressive halide salts and water vapor released during biomass fuel combustion.  The Department of Energy desires the development of low-cost survivable components that extend the lifetime of critical components that will encourage the adoption of sustainable biomass feedstocks.  A unique cyclic high-voltage anodizing process is proposed to convert liquid aluminum-nitrate and zirconium-fluoride electrolytes into crystalline aluminum- oxide and zirconium-oxide coatings on low-cost steel substrates.  The thick crystalline oxide has a dense inner zone (nearest the substrate) which prevents corrodent penetration to the steel and encapsulated interior porosity that increases coating toughness/durability.  In addition to the enhanced corrosion-resistance and coating toughness, the liquid-immersion process completely envelopes the component, eliminating line-of-sight limitations common for other coating techniques.  Thus complex shaped parts, like combustion chambers and exhaust piping, can be coated on the inside surfaces.  Furthermore, the process is scalable (power supply and tankage) and only requires 3 stages as opposed to 9 stages for conventional anodizing.  In Phase I, crystalline-oxide coatings will be fabricated on steel substrates for coating characterization and testing,  which  will  include  adhesion/toughness  measurements,  coating  porosity  and microstructure  examinations,  and  exposure  to  high-temperature  (>600C)  cookstove environments (continuous and cycling operations).   This technology has many applications in several diverse industries, including:  1) pump parts for oil/gas hydraulic-fracturing, 2) erosion- resistant surfaces for air ventilation fan blades in mines, turbine engine blades, aircraft landing gears, 3) abrasion resistance of pipe inside surfaces that carry slurry solutions, 4) abrasion- resistance of recreational vehicle parts, and 5) components of chemical-process combustors. Further development and scaling of this technology in Phase II will enable the cost-effective fabrication  of  combustor  components  that  offer  longer  lifetimes  and  higher  durability  than current materials used for these components.  As a result, cookstoves will be manufactured that last  longer  and  are  lower  cost  than  currently  offered  products. Furthermore,  the  reduced emissions from these cookstoves will reduce health risks to the operators."

While traditional Si-PCSS systems have demonstrated poor recovery time (tens to hundreds of microseconds), new understanding in absolute photo-carrier generation and the resultant reduced sweepout time, provides one means to get beyond this seemingly fundamental limitation. The proposed work is a mix of research and development. The research aims to find the limits of switch recovery time that go beyond the phase I requirements while the objective of the development effort is to build, test and demonstrate a transition-capable Si-PCSS system that meets the phase I specific requirements. The research and development effort together form the basis to meet the phase II requirements. The effort builds on preliminary results, which show that reduced optical trigger energy per pulse onto a Si-PCSS can reduce recovery time relative to commercially available Si-PCSS systems by at least one order-of-magnitude. Based on these results, the investigators will study, refine and implement the laser energy density (beam size) and laser energy placement onto silicon p-i-n heterostructures as a function of absolute trigger energy, heterostructure type, operational voltage (> 1500-V), and heterostructure aspect ratio."

Common ignition systems are based on a spark gap driven by a pulse transformer ignition coil). Unfortunately, these systems have small plasma excitation areas, are slow, wear down the spark plug electrodes, and are not suitable for high pressure engines. The use of transient plasma ignition systems has already been demonstrated as effective in standard gasoline engines. This work extends the application of transient plasma ignitions into high pressure, lean burn engines by developing a Spark Plug Equivalent device driven by a tailored high voltage, pulsed power source. Two objectives will be achieved in Phase I.  First, transient plasma generation will be demonstrated at 100 atmospheres in dry air, with corona extending past the Spark Plug Equivalent and into the ignition chamber. This will be documented with a high speed camera in a pressure vessel with a window. Second, the ignition of lean fuel ratios of 20:1 at 100 atmospheres will be demonstrated at temperatures similar to those in an internal combustion engine. Phase II and beyond will demonstrate the implementation and reliable operation of transient plasma based ignition systems in lean burn, high pressure gasoline engines. This system will ignite a significantly larger volume of the engine cylinder when compared to a spark plug based system, minimizing the effects of a non-uniform fuel/air mixture.  Thus, a faster burn rate with a more consistent burn will be achieved. When compared with standard ignition system timing, this method requires less advancement before the piston reaches top dead center, resulting in higher efficiency.

The Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards set a 54.5 miles per gallon average fuel economy goal for 2025. This provides a strong incentive for automobile manufacturers to improve their fuel economy fleet wide. Transient plasma ignition has already demonstrated its ability to provide increased fuel economy in standard engines. Lean burn, high pressure engines provide another way to increase efficiency. The merger of these technologies provides one avenue that should be considered in order to meet the efficiency standards."

Purpose: This project team will develop and test iASK, an app intended to assess and support increased word recognition among middle school students who struggle to read. The 2013 National Assessment of Education Progress reported that 66% of middle school students scored below proficient in reading, and 22% scored below basic, the lowest performance level. Students who struggle to read often have deficits in word recognition, which, in turn, inhibits comprehension. In general, students who have word deficits and struggle with reading do not receive the individualized support they need. In addition, commonly used screening and progress monitoring instruments often do not provide data that educators can use to provide individualized instruction.

Project Activities: During Phase I (completed in 2014), a prototype app was developed, consisting of a login screen, a back-end database, a library with over 800 items such as words, sound-files, and pictures, and a set of word matching activities. Pilot research with 59 middle school students demonstrated that the prototype operated as intended, and that students enjoyed and were able to successfully complete each of the word matching tasks in the time allotted. In Phase II of the project, the team will design additional activities, and fully develop the back-end assessment system and teacher dashboard. After the development phase is complete, a larger pilot study will assess the feasibility and usability, fidelity of implementation, and the promise of the app for promoting students' word recognition and reading comprehension. The researchers will collect data from 200 middle school students who struggle to read. Half of the students will be randomly assigned to use the app while the other half of students will use a paper-based exercise. Analyses will compare pre-and-post scores of student's vocabulary and reading comprehension.

Product: This project will develop iASK, an app to assess and support increased word recognition among middle school students struggling to read. When using iASK, students will proceed through a series of game-like tasks, such as activities to fill in the blank with the correct word part, to order word parts, or to match words to a corresponding picture. The software will be adaptive, as words will get easier or harder based on the ability of the students to decode word parts. iASK will also include a teacher data dashboard to provide formative assessment reports and visuals to guide further teacher-led instruction."

These wildlife reservoirs represent a potential threat to public health, serving as a continuous and difficult to eradicate source of infection for zoonotic diseases, but may also represent a significant economic threat to US agriculture.    In particular, wild ruminants including white-tail deer may harbor vector-borne infectious diseases that can directly impact US Cattle and Sheep operations.  Medgene Labs focuses on the development of novel subunit vaccine formulations to address these critical diseases that may affect both public health and US agricultural animals.  Subunit vaccines have the advantage of being highly stable and safe from potential reversion to virulence, supporting strong protective immune responses without the potential for contributing to new outbreaks through combination with wild-type agents. Furthermore, these strategies are ideally suited to the development of immune responses to effectively differentiate vaccinated from infected animals (DIVA approach).   Our current development efforts have defined highly efficacious, DIVA-compatible vaccine formulation directed against Rift Valley Fever Virus, and a focus of this proposal is to define an efficacious oral vaccine. This proposal will leverage the existing strength that Medgene Labs brings to the generation of highly effective and safe vaccine strategies directed against RVFV and other orbiviruses of national interest to define appropriate delivery systems for oral vaccination of wildlife.

However, conventional and small hydropower systems for (20,000+) low head dams (550ft.) in the US tend to be extremely costintensive due to a variety of configurational issues. These include coffer dams, power houses, complex foundations, complex unit maintenance, large space requirements, and turbine technology requiring major civil engineering work. These factors have severely limited the number of economicallyviable projects in the low head power range. DOE has identified these dam locations and has challenged industry to produce a unit generating clean power at low cost to the public. The ATS turbine/generator answers this challenge as it provides the hydropower industry with a magnitude lower cost power generation system, requiring no power house, with onefifth weight and volume of a conventional system, simple maintenance and not requiring dam reconstruction. The ATS 63 Turbine/Generator is built primarily of composite materials, massproducible and ranges from 100kW to 2.5MW depending on head and flow. The low cost avoids the need for subsidy (unlike wind and solar). It will alter the hydropower outlook for the future in the US. The DOE SBIR Phase I project produced the critically peerreviewed unit design (based on an earlier test of a scale model validating the concept). Material strengthand costanalysis validated the design, and in a Phase II project, ATS will build the first unit and test it on a dam or canal. Mass production manufacture can be started on completion of the Phase II test, eventually employing an estimated 300 people in less than five years. In Phase III, ATS will install multiple units on a large US river dam, confirming a lowcost solution for power generation to all large dams including the Army Corps of Engineers lowhead dams in the US major rivers and lakes.   Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  A world market of at least $83 billion, excluding China (having 49% of all hydropower) is estimated based on a preliminary market study by an independent leading consulting group. The commercialization plan provides for a pathway to economic success, made in the USA."

70m for both land-based and off-shore installations.  There is a rapid ramp in cost associated with ground transportation of blades longer than 65m, rising to a threshold that is considered practically prohibitive for blades longer than 75m. Managing the quality of such large blades using conventional manufacturing methods is also becoming increasingly challenging. As a product of the SBIR Phase 2 R & amp;D, Wetzel Engineering will create a Field-Assembled Component- Based Rotor Blade technology that addresses the above concerns.  The blade is assembled in the field from factory-built sections sized to be easily transportable, and both the manufacturing and assembly are performed on open fixtures such that the quality can be inspected carefully before finish. During Phase 1, Wetzel Engineering identified the optimal configuration for sectioning a blade for more cost effective manufacturing, transportation, and field assembly.   We also performed structural engineering  of  the  major  components  of  the  blade,  assessing  the  feasibility  of  the  concept  and identifying the potential cost and performance benefits of the technology. Phase 1 validated that the concept has merit and should be developed further in a Phase 2 SBIR project. During Phase 2 Wetzel Engineering will optimize the engineering of the structural components used in forming the blade through a program of comprehensive component and substructure testing. We will further validate and refine our understanding of the technology by building a 41m subscale test blade and subjecting it to static and fatigue testing. Finally, we will validate the scalability of the technology by engineering an 83m component-based blade for operation on a land-based 6MW wind turbine.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  Wetzel Engineering, working with its Wetzel Blade manufacturing affiliate, will commercialize the technology by manufacturing 41 and 46m blades for the US domestic replacement blade market for aging 1.5-2.0MW turbines and by manufacturing 83, 90, and 100m blades for 6-10MW wind turbines for the worldwide off-shore and large land-based wind industry.

Population growth and intensive use in cities and agro industrial activities threatens the depletion of this resource in many parts of the world. This depletion poses many major social and economic concerns. As a result, efforts have been made to develop economically viable technologies to make potable water from seawater or brackish water resources. Today, 40% of desalination is accomplished through Reverse Osmosis (RO) technology (Greenlee, 2009). While RO has proven to be an effective technology, almost 40% of the operating costs involved in the process are energy-related (SNL, 2003). A multi stage activated char filtration with Capacity Deionization (CDI) technology is herein proposed as a novel approach for water filtration. The removal of organic and inorganic compounds can be achieved in a series of activated char modules to selectively remove contaminants in a more inexpensive and environmentally friendly manner. By using electric energy on a porous media (e.g. activated char), ions from salt can be retained. Thus activated char and CDI can produce fresh water while potentially using significantly less energy than RO (Porada, 2013). Biochar produced through the pyrolysis technology can enhance the adsorption of anions, cations or remove organic molecules (in similar fashion to activated carbon). Coupling this technology with the use of CDI in an electrode configuration will enhance the adsorption of smaller and more challenging ions. The pyrolysis process can be tailored to produce biochar to match specific  equirements for both cathode and anode electrode configurations. Successful use of biochar in the CDI process would not only reduce process production costs, but would also further enhance sustainability. Biochar is principally composed of structurally resilient carbon. It reduces CO2 emissions from the manufacturing process compared to traditional activated carbon due to its renewable precursor feedstock and the slow decay of its recalcitrant carbon structure. Current water desalination techniques require large energy inputs and high capital costs. Reverse osmosis is not suited for small scale applications and requires expensive energy recovery systems.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The use of multiple-stage activated char with capacitive deionization can provide important reductions in energy use for the desalination in small scale and remote water purification facilities. Compared to current membrane deionization technologies, this new technology includes significantly less infrastructure, capital costs and complexity for the development and operation."

AAA is a conceptual aircraft design and analysis tool using semi-empirical and physics based methods.  It is used for military (fighters, bombers, UAV""s), commercial and general aviation aircraft.  These higher fidelity models include simplified analyses for aerodynamic characteristics, structural integrity and weight & balance considerations based on the amount of information that is known in the preliminary design stages.  All of these capabilities will be incorporated into a multidisciplinary optimization tool to aid designers in defining a configuration that warrants further investigation and/or detailed design.  As more information is known about the configuration better decisions can be made, resulting in better/more efficient designs in less time. This technology will allow smaller design teams to develop initial concepts that can then be seamlessly transferred to the detailed design groups and reduce the time required taking a conceptual design all the way to detailed design.  BENEFIT:  It is expected that design cost will significantly decrease using this system.  More configurations can be analyzed in less time.  Ease of use will prevent errors and improve time to market.  The commercial potential is a design tool that is for sale.  It can also be used at universities to teach airplane design."

Using ALE3D we have also been able to qualitatively describe the major hydrodynamic processes involved in the collapse and subsequent expansion of the assembly.  In Phase II we propose a continuation and expansion of these early efforts that will result in a similar amount of reaction, but which will occur on a much shorter time scale (hundreds of s), and potentially result in a detonation.  We will begin to examine other effects, such as the use of reactive cases and the external flow associated with missile trajectory.  We will also begin to remedy the problem of not having a complete equation of state for the JP10 along with other computational issues.  BENEFIT:  The results of the experimental and theoretical programs from Phase I have clearly demonstrated the feasibility of the technical goals of this SBIR.  We have shown near quantitative conversion of the JP10 in times less than 30 ms and our calculations have shown the influence of different design parameters and how they can be changed in order to increase the rate of reaction through improved mixing and heating.  In Phase II we intend to use the data and modeling generated in Phase I to dramatically improve the time scale of reaction by improving the mixing and directionality of the dispersing fuel cloud, and also study the effects of the flow along the missile body.  The ultimate goal is to convert all the fuel remaining in the tank to products of combustion either through a detonative event or high rate oxidation.  We will also investigate the effects of various catalysts to further enhance reactivity."

But, the proliferation of sensor systems has created a large volume of multi-sensor data across a number of physical spectra. These resulting measurements can be so disparate that traditional aggregation methods perform poorly given heuristics/assumptions required to map them into conventional algorithms.  The team of 21st Century Systems, Inc. (21CSi) and the Missouri University of Science and Technology (MS & T) propose to develop an innovative multiphysics-based sensor fusion approach, called Voxel Fusion (VOXION).  Applicable for improving target detection and discrimination in the ISR domain, VOXION maps the disparate sensor fields from a suite of EO/IR, RF and acoustic sensors into a single common multiphysics-based representation.  Estimates on target parameters are then obtained directly from the unified physics field improving system accuracy, decreasing uncertainty, and achieving improved inferences more resilient to changes in the targets and environmental conditions as compared to classical fusion approaches. The innovative voxel-based concept; our diverse, well-qualified team; combined with 21CSi""s superlative, sustained record in SBIR/STTR commercialization; makes our team the right choice to improve multiphysics-based sensor fusion for the warfighter.  BENEFIT:  The VOXION multiphysics-based sensor fusion algorithm will be able to map the disparate sensor fields into a single common multiphysics representation that is needed to improve target detection and discrimination in the ISR domain.   VOXION would generate estimates of target parameters from a unified physics representation of objects, improving system accuracy, decreasing uncertainty, and achieving improved inferences more robust to changes in the targets and environmental conditions.  Thus, VOXION will markedly improve the fusion of data from disparate sensor types in order to improve situational awareness and sensor hand-offs. The VOXION technology has the potential of maturing into a cohesive multi-sensor fusion tool to assist in the traditionally manual processes of unlike sensor aggregation. This will not only improve the accuracy of the resulting situational awareness picture, but also allow for faster situation recognition and more rapid actionable intelligence. Bottom line...faster, better decisions."

In such high speed vertical lift configurations, even though the aircraft may be cruising at compressible Mach numbers, incompressible flow pockets can occur in the wake of the fuselage. Hence, in contrast to most helicopters currently in use, these configurations need to be analyzed across a wide range of speed regimes including incompressible, compressible and mixed regimes.

The present proposal offers to extend the design tool ``RotCFD'' to viscous all-speeds with mixed incompressible and compressible regions. In general, the algorithms used in CFD are designed for incompressible flow or compressible flow, depending upon the primary usage. RotCFD, being an Integrated Design Environment (IDE) for rotors, can be developed to seamlessly work in both regimes without additional input besides the operating speed from the design community. Additionally, this proposal offers to extend RotCFD to include grid generation with bodies in relative motion, such as tilting nacelles and wing tips, which happens in transitioning flight. 

The proposed extension of RotCFD for all-speed regimes and flows with mixed
regimes, if proven successful, will offer the vertical flight scientific community a moderate fidelity, robust and efficient design tool. With the added potential to simulate relative motion of components, the tool will provide an analysis capability for all operational regimes: hover, conversion and cruise."

The opportunity is to build technology to create a candidate recommendation system incorporating feedback on relevance of its performance. The research objective is to determine if integrating semantic matching and machine learning provides a feasible basis for creating a commercially viable predictive candidate recommendation system. The natural language processing techniques, and the ontology knowledge base developed during this research, have the potential to advance knowledge and understanding of using natural text to express the availability of skills and experience. The anticipated result is the creation of a human capital ontology structure and rules that learn from feedback loops of rank-order successes to improve semantic matching. While this project assesses the significance of ontology and machine learning to improve the quality of candidate recommendations, the results also enhance technological understanding of combining ontology and machine learning within broader work-force science research. The broader/commercial impact of this product is to significantly increase the success of selected applicants and improve employers&#039; ability to manage human capital selection efficiently and at less cost by presenting them with a more accurate short-list. Identifying the most qualified candidates should increase the return on investment in over $6 billion spent annually by businesses in the United States for online recruiting efforts ultimately resulting in greater organizational competence and competitive advantage. By implementing technology that automates the process of rank-ordering job candidates based on skills, qualifications, and machine-learning from historical selections, businesses will be able to reduce costs associated with identifying quality job candidates while dealing with the growing challenge of talent shortages, especially in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) professions. The feedback loop provides for knowledge acquisition to be integrated; thus improving results over time and reducing effort needed to identify qualified candidates.

This manufacturing platform will utilize biologically derived sugar carbon-source and transform this carbon to higher value products via microbial fermentation. At the core of this new manufacturing platform is a re-designed microorganism that will deliver homogeneous preparations of individual fatty acids of defined carbon-chain length that contain a single carbon-carbon double bond. This contrasts with current sources of oleochemicals, which are complex mixtures of fatty acids of different carbon chain lengths ranging between 12 and 18 carbon atoms, and may contain 0-3 carbon-carbon double bonds. The complex mixtures that occur in these oleochemicals limit the types of products that can be generated from fats and oils, or adds considerable separations cost to the manufacture of homogeneous products. The project will take advantage of unprecedented technological capability to produce homogeneous preparations of a single monounsaturated fatty acid, which is a platform feedstock for producing many chemicals that impact surfactant, lubricant, and polymer markets, currently valued at $40B per annum, and predicted to grow to $150B per annum in the next 5-years. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop new transformational technology that is based on the discovery and fundamental understanding of the biocatalytic mechanism that terminates the elongation cycle of Type II fatty acid synthase, the enzyme acyl-ACP thioesterase. The project will harness this technology for the production of near homogeneous preparations (~60%) of the monounsaturated fatty acid, 7-tetradecenoic acid, and proposes to optimize the system to produce over 80% homogeneous preparations of this fatty acid. This monounsaturated fatty acid is not currently available in the marketplace at a reasonable cost. The unprecedented availability of 7-tetradecenoic acid makes it a platform biochemical for subsequent chemical conversion to numerous biorenewable chemicals that have applications in surfactants, lubricants, and polymers. In the long-term, this platform technology can be expanded to produce alternative homogeneous preparations of monounsaturated fatty acids of different chain lengths, with carbon-carbon double bonds at different but defined places in the molecule."

Compared to competitive products (e.g., packed resin beads or microfiber adsorption membranes), these nanofiber membranes/felts will provide greatly enhanced throughput (i.e., shorter processing times), reduce the amount of waste generated, and decrease the volume of media required (i.e., lower costs and smaller operating footprints) for purification of high-value biopharmaceutical products. The SBIR Phase I project was completed successfully by developing a manufacturing process for the functionalized nanofiber felts and proving superior performance compared to commercial products. This SBIR Phase II project will focus on further optimization of the formulations used during production of the nanofiber adsorbents for bioseparations. This will include two scale-up steps needed for the commercial manufacturing effort anticipated during the Phase II timeline (nanofiber felt production, surface functionalization, and module development). Key technical improvements, including greater product stability and a broader array of functional ligands needed in bioseparations, will continue to be made to the nanofiber felts/mats. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project goes well beyond bioseparations. Due to the many advantages of the surface-functionalized electrospun nanofibers made from regenerated cellulose, this innovative adsorption material has tremendous commercial potential. Customers will come from companies within the biopharmaceutical industry, as well as from the established manufacturers of bioseparations adsorption media. Additionally, the underlying fundamentals associated with nanofiber adsorption media will have a wide range of implications, including more efficient separation processes in the water purification industry and the blood products and/or blood purification industries. The advantages achieved through this innovative work will lead to more efficient separation technologies across many sectors and include faster processes, reduced energy consumption, lower materials requirements, and less waste generation. In addition to the broader scientific impacts, Nanofiber Separations, LLC is committed to creating jobs and to training highly technical staff members, providing them with expertise in the interdisciplinary fields of advanced functional materials (including nano-scaled materials) and/or biotechnology."

This directly addresses the need for improved biopharmaceutical production monitoring. The current manual sampling and off-line analysis methods have significant limitations including contamination risks and inherent time delays that severely limit process control. The primary objectives of this effort include the optimization of a high brightness super luminescent diode (SLD) light source and the accompanying optical probe. The SLD provides the light throughput that is required for quantitative in situ measurements, and is perfectly suited for light coupling to an optical-fiber probe. This approach has the added advantage of multiplexing, thereby enabling a single monitor system to simultaneously track analyte concentrations in multiple bioreactors. Both the probe and SLD will be rigorously tested through a series of benchtop and live fermentation evaluations. The ultimate outcome of this effort will be a market-ready, probe-based bioreactor monitor compatible with the major expression platforms in the biopharmaceutical industry. The broader impact/commercial potential of this proposed project, if successful, will be to enable the fast-growing biopharmaceutical industry to make game-changing advances in the development and production of critically important drugs. By replacing current manual chemical measurement methods performed during the production of biopharmaceuticals with automated and continuous monitoring, this real-time probe-based monitor will enable needed improvements in process efficiency, lead to reduced development costs, and accelerate the time to market for state-of-the-art drugs. Because of the high value of these medications, and the driving market need, the commercial potential for this real-time monitor is significant with a specific market niche estimated at $510 million in the U.S. alone, residing in the larger global biologics market estimated at $239 billion by 2015.

Ground Fluor Pharmaceuticals (GFP) developed proprietary single-step fluorination technology that allows [18F]-labeled medicines to be prepared efficiently from cyclotron-produced [18F]-fluoride. Under this Phase II research project GFP will apply its new technology to produce the imaging agent 6- [18F]fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA), a compound useful in diagnosing Parkinson&#039;s disease and in cancer imaging, that is not currently readily available because of the difficulty in its production. GFP will scale-up and manufacture pharmaceutical grade ALPDOPA (GFP&#039;s precursor to FDOPA) under pharmaceutical cGMP conditions, and offer this material for research studies and for clinical imaging. GFP will develop an FDA drug master file and will provide technical and regulatory assistance to cyclotron pharmacy customers adopting GFP&#039;s technology for commercial production of FDOPA. In addition to helping to bring this valuable imaging agent to market, GFP will assist academic and pharmaceutical research groups in the development of new [18F]- fluorinated imaging products. The broader impact/commercial potential is to expand the scope and utility of PET as medical diagnostic tool, thereby improving treatment and management of serious medical problems. Although [18F]-fluoride possesses, perhaps, the most advantageous properties for imaging, is relatively inexpensive, and is widely available, it is difficult to incorporate into medicines for imaging. GFP has developed a general enabling technology that uses the relatively inexpensive and widely available form of [18F]-fluoride to create new molecular imaging agents to advance personalized medicine. This technology, and the compounds it creates, will provide the physician with new opportunities to diagnose, assess, and more efficiently treat unmet medical needs.

While abstinence is a cornerstone of treatment, there is considerable interest in identifying other therapeutic interventions for alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Such advances are complicated by an incomplete understanding of the relationship between alcohol-specific metabolic responses and liver pathophysiology. The induction of a pro-inflammatory state, hallmark of ALD, appears to depend upon the unfavorable interplay among reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein adduct formation, and both the innate and adaptive immune responses. In this SBIR Phase I project, we hypothesize that the formation of highly reactive compounds, termed ?-ketoaldehydes (?-KA), formed primarily by non-enzymatic free radical catalyzed lipid peroxidation and secondarily by cyclooxygenases (COX) activity, is crucial for ethanol-induced liver injury."

This Omega-3 DDGS will also provide highly digestible microbial and plant proteins. The aquaculture industry has grown at a 9% rate for the past decade due to increased demand for fish protein and reduced capture of wild fish. Both fish oil and fish meal are key ingredients in aquaculture feeds, but unfortunately their production from wild-caught fishes cannot meet worldwide feedstuff demand. The limited availability and high prices of fish oil and meal have increased aquaculture feed costs, reduced profitability, and thus limited expansion of the U.S. aquaculture industry. There is a significant market opportunity for more sustainable replacements for fish oil and meal. Through prior NSF SBIR funding, Prairie AquaTech has developed a micro-fungal process to convert soybean meal (SBM) into a high protein product (marketed as PisciZyme) that is successfully replacing fish meal in pilot and commercial scale trials. A USDA SBIR grant to convert DDGS into a fish meal replacement is underway.To replace fish oil Prairie AquaTech proposes to convert 1) sugars and glycerol in distillers & #39; grains to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and protein using Schizochytrium limacinum, and 2) sugars, organic acids, and glycerol in condensed corn solubles to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and protein using Pythium irregulare. Phase I objectives will include generating sufficient quantities of Omega-3 DDGS for digestibility and feeding trials with yellow perch (Perca flavescens) to assess technical and economic feasibility. The first generation Omega-3 DDGS is anticipated to have & gt;1.5% of both DHA and EPA, and & gt;45% protein, while providing desirable fish growth rates and conversion efficiencies at & gt;30% fish oil replacement levels. Phase II will further optimize the Omega-3 DDGS production process, targeting & gt;3% of both DHA and EPA, and & gt;50% protein. Pending Phase I results we will also test the Omega-3 DDGS product in other commercially important food fishes, validate process costs and energy requirements, and complete initial steps for scale-up and commercialization (including AAFCO approvals).The Prairie AquaTech value proposition is that our microbial technologies will generate low cost, highly digestible aquaculture feeds from sustainable plant-based coproducts. Preliminary work has documented that DDGS fractions can be efficiently converted into DHA and EPA. This Phase I proposal will demonstrate commercial feasibility. Omega-3 DDGS production costs are estimated at $400-450/ton, compared to fish oil at $1,760-2,440/ton. Existing technologies cannot offer a DHA, EPA, and protein enhanced feedstuff at this price. Fish oil alternatives, such as flax oil (lacks DHA and EPA) and photosynthetic algal oil (high production and recovery costs), have proven impractical. Our primary target audience will be aquaculture producers (eg. Bell Aquaculture and Clear Springs), feed manufacturers (eg. Purina, Zeigler, Skretting), and corn processors. Each will benefit from the conversion of low-value corn ethanol coproducts into high value aquaculture feedstuffs. Prairie AquaTech & #39;s economical and sustainable source of DHA, EPA, and protein will encourage growth of domestic aquaculture operations to help meet USDA & #39;s strategic goals related to agricultural development and food security."

However, a great opportunity to enrich the lives of this community has sprung from a forward-thinking, $8.1 billion, ""NorthSide Regeneration Plan"" which is developing this area through the strategic planning of building 10,000 new homes, along with parks, schools, churches and three major employment centers.Good Natured Family Farms will promote and support this community & #39;s robust regeneration through research funded by the Small Business Research Innovation grant to determine the feasibility of developing a Good Natured Food Campus that will increase the accessibility of local and fresh food to an under-served population, while assisting small to mid-size farms to process and commercialize their meats, dairy and produce.The purpose of establishing the Food Campus is to bring the aggregation and distribution of fresh, local food from small to mid-size farms to the family tables of vulnerable populations, thereby creating more marketing opportunities for the farmers and better nutrition for the at-risk population. The program will also provide educational and job training in food science and nutrition. Good Natured Family Farms has successfully developed and implemented a similiar concept ifor an under-served community in Kansas and now strives to to develop a sister Food Campus in this Missouri community.An overarching goal of the Good Natured Food Campus is to contribute to the improvement of the nation & #39;s nutrition and health, to support local, small and mid-size family farms, stimulate monetary circulation in the local economy, increase commerce and tax revenues, and reduce vulnerability to oil shortages, transportation problems, and large-scale food contamination."

Each tool combines remotely-sensed, high-resolution digital elevation models (LiDAR) and newly developed hydrologic algorithms with long standing soil-loss modeling principles. The results to date are two-dimensional, distributed (grid-based) soil loss models for sheet and rill erosion and ephemeral gully erosion. However, with flow networks that may approach one-million cells on one to three-meter raster spacing, runtimes for a single rasterized field take several hours. The models are not practical to deploy at a large scale for localized conservation planning.The proposed Phase I work plan will determine the technical feasibility of optimizing the SoilLossCalculator code set to meet user requirements in a web-based system. In order to be commercially viable, the model needs to process an entire field and return a result to the user in under one-minute, requiring the execution time to be reduced by about 400 times. Research questions that will be explored include:Where within the model infrastructure are opportunities for significant speed increases?What alterations to the code set can be proposed as possible options for further optimization?What approximate decrease in execution time may be realized by each proposed change?What are the estimated time and resource requirements for each proposed code modification?The proposed project expands the research and development of models for distributed erosion modeling, which are substantial scientific improvements over existing soil loss modeling tools. Moreover, if successful, these efforts will make the concepts of precision conservation a practical reality for land managers. Conservation practitioners will be able to quickly and easily target appropriate management practices to landscape positions that contribute the most significant sediment loads and evaluate which practice alternatives provide the most environmental benefit.If optimization efforts prove successful, Agren intends to incorporate both the SoilLossCalculator and ephemeral gully calculator models into their commercially-available suite of conservation planning tools. Agren provides access to the conservation planning tools through a web-based, Software as a Service model. Subscribers pick and choose from a suite of conservation practice planning tools to create a package that best suits their local needs. Agren & #39;s target markets include both public sector conservation planning agencies and private sector audiences such as engineering firms, land improvement contractors, and agricultural retailers."

If this trend is to be reversed, new tools for sorghum crop improvement are needed. Sorghum is a naturally drought-tolerant, heat-resistant crop that can play an important role in meeting ever-increasing global needs for food, feed, and fuel. However, sorghum lags behind other crops in making progress on breeding for yield increase and trait enhancement. Heartland Plant Innovations proposes to put sorghum improvement on a new trajectory by developing a robust system for producing and utilizing Sorghum Doubled Haploids (SDHs) in breeding and genetics. Developing a Sorghum Doubled Haploid Breeding System will offer a greatly accelerated route to new improved hybrids, increased yields for farmers, and better food production in the U.S. and around the world.HPI & #39;s SDH project will identify pollinators cabable of inducing haploid embryo development in a wide range of sorghum gentypes and build a DH breeding system around the use of these pollinators. Once this technology is developed, public and private sorghum breeding and crop improvement programs will have a new and faster way of delivering valuable sorghum hybrids that will improve the lives of sorghum farmers and people who depend on their crops. Sorghum Doubled Haploids will deliver true-breeding recombinant lines for breeders in a single plant generation, cutting in half the time required to give farmers higher yielding, healthier sorghum hybrids."

Commercially available vaccines, however, are often difficult and costly for livestock producers to use properly, leaving individual animals - and by extension the global food supply - at risk. More specifically, many vaccines on the market today require multiple injections spaced several weeks apart (i.e. primer dose; two (or more) week delay period; booster dose) to achieve a protective level of immunity in the host animal. These booster doses are often not administered for a variety of reasons, including: (1) the cost and logistical difficulty of rounding up livestock that graze over large areas of land and (2) the nature of the livestock supply chain (e.g. the animal receives the primer does, but is sold to a finishing lot before the booster dose is administered). Taken together, there is a critical need for new livestock vaccines that eliminate the necessity for booster injections."

The FAO estimates that aquaculture will soon overtake captured fisheries as a source of food fish. The rapid global expansion of aquaculture has led to a corresponding increase in demand for fish meal protein, the primary ingredient in aquaculture feeds. Meanwhile, the harvest of species used to produce fish meal has been on a steady decline over the last decade due to the same over-exploitation that has impacted fish/shellfish production. These trends are unsustainable, as aquaculture will soon consume the entire fish meal resource. This is reflected in the rapid escalation of fish meal prices (exceeding $2,000/MT in some cases) which are already affecting the profitability of aquaculture operations. Adding to this problem are competing uses for fish meal in other livestock and companion animal feeds. Consequently, there is a significant market opportunity for a high quality, economical plant protein concentrate to replace fish meal in aquaculture and other feed markets.Distillers & #39; dried grains with solubles (DDGS) has been tested as a partial replacement for fish meal, however the relatively low protein content and less than desirable amino acid profile have limited inclusion rates to low levels. In our Phase I study, Prairie AquaTech showed that our High Protein DDGS (HP-DDGS) performed substantially better in relative growth performance compared to unconverted DDG. Recent modifications to our microbial conversion process resulted in enhanced HP-DDGS protein levels that we expect will result in growth performance metrics more comparable to fish meal. This Phase II project will further develop and commercialize this innovative process through the following objectives: & bull; Optimize the HP-DDGS production process, and scale-up to the pilot scale level; & bull; Test the resultant HP-DDGS as a replacement for fish meal in grower diets; & bull; Validate process costs and energy requirements for the pilot scale system; and & bull; Complete initial steps for commercial scale-up and deployment.This will involve the coordinated efforts of our experienced team of scientists, engineers, and business development specialists whose comparable work to develop a high protein soybean meal replacement for fish meal (PisciZyme & trade;) has already received national awards and is transitioning through an NSF SBIR Phase II award into commercialization.Commercial deployment of the proposed HP-DDGS product will further increase the availability of plant-based proteins as direct replacements for animal-based proteins, which are costly, over-exploited, and generally unsustainable. This technology will also bring more value to and higher use of the chief by-product of U.S. corn ethanol production, of which one third is currently exported. This innovation will increase U.S. food supply security by providing domestic aquaculture producers with a lower cost and more sustainable replacement for imported fishmeal, while increasing their economic competitiveness. This will encourage industry expansion as supported by current USDA, NOAA, and Department of Commerce initiatives."

Several key factors have limited Lactipro widespread adoption by beef and dairy producers, including the current short shelf life of 14 days and the large dose volume. Phase I research demonstrated cold storage of Lactipro with osmoprotectants and concentration with a filtration system to be feasible. The objective of our Phase II program is to develop a concentrated, lyophilized, second generation Lactipro with extended shelf life and reduced dose size. Phase II research will first implement the filtration system in our production line to concentrate the culture and then investigate optimal freeze drying protocols and storage by testing different combinations of cryoprotectants, freezing treatments, freeze drying cycles, and storage conditions. The most promising combination will then be tested in vivo to confirm efficacy in feedlot cattle.Success of the Phase II research will lead to the commercialization of a second generation Lactipro, which will facilitate adoption by our customers. Extended shelf life and decreased dose size will allow for easier logistics and administration, considerably enhancing end user satisfaction. Additionally, it will permit shipping to non-domestic markets, hence protecting manufacturing trade secrets, creating jobs, and benefiting the American economy."

DGS typically replaces corn and protein supplements in the ration, but is has a much higher phosphorus concentration than corn. Therefore, the inclusion of DGS in livestock rations can significantly increase the phosphorus content in the excreted manure. Reducing the concentration of phosphorus in DGS would reduce the amount of excess phosphorus being fed to livestock, thereby decreasing any risk of surface water pollution from manure phosphorus.This project aims build upon the success of the Phase I project by conducting further research and development aimed at recovering excess phosphorus from ethanol condensed thin stillage (CTS). The system will remove soluble phosphorus from CTS, by converting it to the insoluble magnesium phosphate compound. The removed phosphorus would be a useful fertilizer for field crops or horticultural use. Similar technology has already been successfully used to remove phosphorus from liquid manure at confined animal feeding operations. Removing phosphorus at the ethanol plant would be more efficient, and impact a larger number of livestock operations at minimal (if any) cost to the livestock producer. Phase I results indicate that a reduction of soluble phosphorus in the CTS by 72% could decrease the excreted phosphorus at a beef feedlot by 36% when fed at 40% dry matter inclusion rate in common feedlot rations. There is no other beef feedlot management practice or technology available to reduce the excreted phosphorus so substantially while maintaining the same ration.This project will determine the reactor configuration, equipment needs, and operating conditions required for successful operation at an ethanol plant, as well as determine the fertilizer production at those optimal settings and normal conditions. The project will also test the fertilizer efficacy relative to common commercial fertilizers. Successful completion of the project would put KEMA in a position to license the technology for full-scale, commercial production."

The feasibility of the deep borehole option relies upon the design and construction of an effective seal within the borehole that ensures the waste package does not communicate for thousands of years with the shallow subsurface and biosphere through the borehole itself. Recent work has suggested that encapsulating the waste in melted rock will create a seal that is more reliable and long-lasting than conventional sealing materials, such as cement and bentonite. In situ, field-scale demonstrations of the rock melt system are necessary to validate its effectiveness. The proposed project consists of designing a remote, electrical rock melt borehole sealing system and evaluating the feasibility of establishing an experimental area in an underground environment (the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), located at the former Homestake Gold Mine in western South Dakota) where the performance of the system can be tested and validated.  The major tasks envisaged for the Phase I work plan consist of the following: 1.Laboratory testing to obtain applicable thermal properties; 2. Preliminary modeling to determine the requirements of the heater system; 3. Preliminary design of a heater system; 4. Preliminary experiment design at SURF, including identification of underground candidate sites and preliminary experiment cost estimates. In situ melting experiments performed at the SURF provide a unique opportunity to both evaluate seal designs in a deep underground environment and perform a mine-back excavation and forensic analysis of the seal design system. Several of these types of experiments would evaluate and compare a number of different sealing technologies to assess which seal designs are the most effective.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits:  The demonstration of a successful design rock melt borehole sealing system has the potential to significantly contribute to the U.S. Department of Energy Used Fuel Disposition Campaign and help address an issue of national (and international) importance. In addition to the obvious benefit to the Used Fuel Disposition Campaign, the validation of sealing technology will also benefit other entities which operate in deep borehole environments, such as the oil and gas industry and deep, hazardous waste disposal industries. The development of a retrievable heating system that could be used to melt either the host rock or backfill materials into an effective borehole seal could prove to be a more robust (and potentially cost-efficient) option than conventional sealing methods."

Furthermore, the devices must be insensitive to gamma rays while retaining high thermal-neutron intrinsic detection efficiency, preferably above 30%. The objective of this project is to design and build for the first time a high- efficiency neutron detector array consisting of 2880-pixels, with each pixel being approximately 100- microns wide and 4-cm tall, all based on the microstructured semiconductor neutron detector technology. In addition, the detector array has the potential to be curved to the exact focal point of the work space to reduce parallax effects.

While traditional contrast agents are suitable for many clinical imaging approaches, new fields of medicine, such as stem cell transplantation, and improvements in imaging technology are creating small?but growing?niches for more sophisticated contrast agents than what is traditionally used. For instance, there is a great deal of interest in functionalized contrast agents which tag specific cells based on surface markers, or are internalized by stem cells prior to transplantation so that the cell bolus may be tracked non-invasively to its site of engraftment. To address these markets, this project intends to develop a range of imaging tools based on mesoporous silica. The 50-200 nanometer particles have 3-4 nm pores into which a drug or other bioactive molecule can be loaded, and with further surface functionalization to give the particle contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), ultrasound and fluorescent microscopy. The result is a multi-modal, multifunctional particle that addresses all the needs of state-of-the-art bioimaging. begins with the relative ease and very low cost of production of our mesoporous silica nanoparticles, which can be priced competitively with other products that have a fraction of the functionality: quantum dots, traditional contrast agents, and even other novel contrast agents, which may be used for stem cell tracking, but only one imaging modality. This includes new products offered by other niche manufacturers. Using these nanoparticles, an investigator can label a stem cell transplant, use ultrasound for an image-guided deployment of the cells into a host animal, and perform follow-up studies with MRI or CT. After the experiment, histology can be performed to detect labeled cells in-situ. With one reagent used through the whole experiment, the investigator can more rapidly assess his/her approach, which leads to a more rapid translation to clinical implementation."

The sensor will advance a technology known as optical feedback cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (OF-CEAS). OF-CEAS can measure absorption more accurately than any other cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy technique because the cavity delivers a much more intense signal beam to the photodetector and thereby enables an unparalleled signal-to-noise ratio (~10,000). OF-CEAS makes it possible to calculate the optical frequency of each measurement point with high accuracy by scanning the laser over a fixed grid of equidistant cavity modes.  OF-CEAS makes it possible to reduce manufacturing costs in many ways:   control the optical feedback by optimizing mirror reflectivities rather than incorporating a Faraday isolator,   calculate the optical frequency of each cavity mode by taking advantage of the fixed grid of cavity modes rather than measuring optical frequency with an expensive wavelength monitor,   incorporate small, relatively inexpensive mirrors into a small (~1 mL) cavity that requires only small quantities of calibration gases,   employ relatively low-cost non-fiber-coupled lasers, and   assemble instruments by mass production techniques. Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are changing the earths climate. Climate change will cause extremely high daily temperatures, increase the frequency of heavy rainfall, intensify droughts, increase the maximum wind speed of cyclones, and cause sea levels to rise. The unavailability of low-cost, high-performance atmospheric CO2 sensors constrains the effort of environmental scientists to monitor CO2 at local, regional, and global scales.  LI-COR Biosciences is introducing a new sensor technology that can measure carbon dioxide with state-of-the-art precision while reducing the price by a factor of 10. Commercial Applications: Scientists in university and government laboratory will apply the proposed sensors to measure carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The sensors will help DOE to achieve its mission, which is to ensure Americas security and prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental, and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology solutions.

The cost of installing conventional hydro power generation equipment would be high and uneconomical.  DOE research confirms that at least 165,000MW of untapped hydroelectric power is available in the US alone.  The sites would provide de-facto distributed power, relieving the grid load.  Most of these dams have a low & quot;head & quot; (under 50ft and some as low as 5ft) and fall in the Small Hydro (0.3 to 40 MW) category.  Conventional hydroelectric systems & apos; major drawbacks are: high cost of equipment and installation, low efficiency because of the use of synchronous generators and mechanical controls; high maintenance cost and inability to install in many otherwise suitable locations because of limited space because of unadaptable configuration (no in-line placement). How problem is being addressed A large portion of these dams could produce power economically with low cost, simple-to-install systems being designed and built by ATS.  Also, a host of non-dam applications known as run-of-the-river power systems and conduit systems are also possible with the same simple ATS-designed concept.  ATS systems are reversible and can function in Pumped Storage plants for power storage and other industrial operations as generators and/or pumps. ATS has built and tested a scale model prototype of this new concept and was successfully validated by the University of Iowa.  The ATS concept can efficiently recover power from 5ft head at a cost in most cases of under $2 million per MW. The ATS low-cost mass producible turbines are made with materials and manufacturing techniques known from marine waterjet manufacturing experience that provide an in-line, compact, low weight, efficient power generating unit, has multiple installation configurations and has its own hoist system for service or replacement in one day. The unit requires no power house and installations can be done without touching the existing dam and take 1-6 months instead of years in an ecologically friendly way as no fish are harmed or nature disturbed. The SBIR application asks for DOE assistance to build the first full size unit to be tested and validated for use on these dams in Phases I and II.  Phase I will provide the completed design developed from the prototype.  The phase II effort will be to build the full scale unit in an actual dam location and the UI Laboratory will validate the operation of the unit. Commercial Applications and other Benefits The untapped hydropower potential in the US is $95 billion and the world potential is estimated to be almost five times that of the US. Major customers will be local governments and owners of existing dams and river tracts.  ATS estimates it will grow to $400 million in sales level in five years, providing over 50,000 homes with hydropower and creating 300+ jobs in a HUB zone in Iowa."

Likewise the next generation sequencing technologies (NGS)are promising technology advances that can effectively detect prevalent somatic mutations in targeted gene panels; however due to the limited quantity of DNA in most patient samples and the abundance of normal DNA when analyzing blood, NGS &#039;loses steam&#039; and its integration with clinical practice is problematic.  For mutations at an abundance of ~2-5% or below, NGS generates false positives (&#039;noise&#039;) independent of sequencing depth; yet these are often the clinically relevant mutations causing resistance todrug treatments. Commercial sample preparation kits for targeted re-sequencing of cancer gene panels have emerged1-3, however they are uniformly unable to detect mutations below a 2% abundance level. Thus, while targeted re-sequencing provides an opportunity for integration of NGS with clinical oncology, the technology is ineffective in detecting DNA mutations in heterogeneous cancers or in circulating DNA.  We intend to use COLD-PCR, a new method that enriches unknown mutation-containing sequences over wild-type, normal alleles during PCR amplification. We have been able to show sequencing of mutations down to 0.02% abundance. However in its current form this method only can be used with single amplicon per reaction, limiting its efficient combination withNGS.  In this project we propose a simple and powerful modification that enables COLD-PCR to be applied on hundreds or thousands of DNA targets in a single reaction, thus enabling mutation enrichment in cancer- specific gene panels prior to NGS. This wouldconvert the rare mutations to high abundance mutations, overcoming the &#039;noise&#039; and avoid the costly need for repeated sequence reads during NGS. This method, known as temperature-tolerant-COLD-PCR (TT-COLD-PCR), will be developed into kits for cancer-specific gene panels, to magnify rare mutations in multiple DNA targets thus enabling expanded application of targeted re-sequencing for heterogeneous cancers or circulating DNA.  This project meets one of the stated aims of the NCI to support the developmentof new methods of diagnosis for the detection, discovery and validation of biomarkers for cancer detection, diagnosis and prognosis.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The selection of the best available cancer treatment is, in many instances, dependent on the genetic profile of the patient&#039;s cancer cells. This can be difficult to determine when there is limited availability of tumor DNA, as when analyzing blood, when obscured by far more abundant healthy cell DNA and when many DNAtargets need to be analyzed. This project aims to develop a multiplexed DNA analysis technique that enriches low abundance cancer mutations in clinical specimens such as blood to improve cancer treatment selection."

Few situations incite more public outcry than when a community learns that their drinking water has been tainted. Two of the biggest threats to groundwater quality in the U.S. are contamination from either chlorinated solvents or petroleum. Currently, there are an estimated 20,000 sites in the U.S. contaminated with chlorinated solvents. Many of these sites are remnants of releases that occurred 20 to 30years ago. Left unattended, the size and scope of the problems associated with these spills have only become exacerbated with time. Likewise, leaking underground storage tanks (UST) containing petroleum are one of the leading causes of groundwater contamination in the United States. Of the 590,000 federally-regulated UST currently in the U.S., approximately 6,000 had confirmed releases in 2011. In the past decade, significant efforts have been devoted to developing innovative remedial technologies to combatthese environmental contaminants. One technology that is relatively mature is the injection of liquid oxidants into contaminated aquifers or in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO). Two roadblocks to successfully implementing ISCO treatments are when contaminants are located in low permeable layers and these finer textured zones do not readily accept liquid injections or when the aquifer is porous enough for liquid injections, but the cohesive properties of the chemical oxidant results in density-driven flow, thereby causing the oxidant to sink and not treat the desired target zone. To address both problems, AirLift Environmental and the University of Nebraska developed slow- release oxidant-paraffin candles, that when inserted into low permeable zones, slowly dissolve and intercept the contaminant. To prevent the oxidant from migrating downward from the candles, pneumatic circulators were developed that aerate or release bubbles at the base of the candle and prevent the oxidant from sinking while greatly facilitating its horizontal distribution. The objective of this research is to design and manufactue slow-release oxidant candles with aerators tips that can be inserted into contaminated aquifers by direct push (i.e., no wells needed). This development will makeit easier and less expensive to install slow-release oxidants and greatly increase its commercial appeal. Proposed research will take place in two stages where prototypes of direct-push candles we be tested in a large groundwater flow model. Direct-push candles with circulators showing the most promise will be scaled up and field tested by quantifying the ability of the oxidant candle system to vertically deliver oxidants evenly to 22-ft. monitoring wells in the field. Chlorinated solvents and petroleum  products are clearly among the top groundwater contaminants worldwide. The proposed innovation is specifically designed to provide a cost-effective and efficient technology to combat public water supplies impacted by these contaminants.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Chlorinated solvents and petroleum products represent two of the major groundwater contaminants observed worldwide. These contaminants can be successfully treated with chemical oxidants but delivering the oxidants towhere the contaminants are located is often the biggest challenge, especially when contaminants are located in low permeable aquifers. This research will develop a slow-release oxidant delivery system with pneumatic circulators that are easy to install and more effective in delivering the oxidant to targeted zones."

Cognitive impairments in the current treatment era are often mild and not readily detectable because currentscreening measures (e.g., the HIV Dementia Scale) lack sensitivity to detect subtle impairments in cognitive function. Although more sensitive tests may exist, the time and cost associated with their administration and interpretation limits the feasibility of their widespread use in detecting  HAND during routine clinic visits. Thus, there is a need for sensitive measures that can be routinely implemented within a busy clinic environment. Tablet computing tools, such as the Apple iPad, are increasingly ubiquitous, and offer an opportunity to potentially implement an intuitive interface for primarily self-directed brief cognitive assessments with automated scoring,  data aggregation, preliminary determination of cognitive impairment in real-time, thus minimizing clinician and staff burden. In Phase I we will develop a brief, iPad-based cognitive screening, adapt it for use in functioning clinics, and validate its utility in detecting cognitive impairment within an HIV+ patient cohort. The aims of this study are to: 1) develop a brief, iPad-based multi-domain cognitive screen capable of detecting subtle neurocognitive impairments in individuals with HIV infection, 2) examine the feasibility of incorporating the new measure in HIV clinics, and 3) conduct a preliminary study examining the (a) reliability and (b) validity of the screen.  To accomplish these aims, we will adapt the existing Brainbaseline suite of measures, based upon preliminary work with HIV+ participants using more time-intensive tests, in order to reduce assessment time to less than 10 minutes. The screening measure will then be deployed in local HIV clinics in order to gather both cognitive performance data, as well as information on its usability and acceptability with patients and care providers. Eighty HIV+ patients will complete the iPad-based assessment in a clinic setting. A subset of 40 HIV+ participants will also be assessed at the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program, where they will receive a comprehensive evaluation to determine a diagnosis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Twenty HIV seronegatives controls will also be evaluated on both the iPad and full neuropsychological test battery, in order to provide a point of comparison for the data collected in the HIV+ participants, as well as examine the relationship between the iPad tests and common neuropsychological tests in individuals without brain dysfunction. All participants (n = 100) will also complete a retesting on the iPad approximately 3 months later, in order to assess the test-retest reliability and possible practice effects associated with the measure.  This would be the first study to develop an iPad-based cognitive screening test targeting HAND, and would provide us with critical information regarding the feasibility of such a measure. Should the overall project be successful, it would provide clinicians with a novel and highly-implementable tool for evaluating patient cognition, and position Digital Artefacts in a key leadership role in te development of user-and clinician- friendly screening measures for HAND and other neurologic conditions.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Difficulties with memory, concentration, and thinking speed remain common in individuals with HIV infection, despite effective medical treatments. Current screening tests are not effective at detecting such impairments. We aim to address this gap in care by developing a brief iPad- based test that would alert physicians to cognitive difficulties, and which could potentially result in alternative treatment strategies for patients."

Access to large neuroimaging data sets is a critical aspect of learning abouthow the brain works both in health and disease. Most typically, large data sets are collected by one investigator, used for a specific purpose, and then often archived. Sometimes these data are shared with collaborators, typically after an extended effort.Such an approach takes a very narrow view of what could be learned from these rich data sets. For example, there are often multiple questions that could be asked but weren&#039;t conceived at the time of the study design. There are also a plethora of advancedanalytic techniques and approaches, developed by multiple groups, which can be applied to these data to identify hidden structure or answer new questions. However, there are many barriers to data sharing of multimodal neuroimaging data and the community has tried for years to confront the various barriers. In this Phase I STTR we are proposing a unique approach which is to take the neuroinformatics tools that we have been developing at the Mind Research Network and create a user friendly neuroinformatics suite which will enable prospective management and sharing of studies, assessments, and neuroimaging data. The ability to handle prospective (ongoing) studies including privacy aspects is, we believe, critical to encouraging sharing as the control of whetherand who to share with will be under the individual investigator&#039;s control. Sharing is then quite simple to enable as all the data are collected, stored, and managed within a larger infrastructure. We plan to explore the feasibility of our approach, whichwill be to market the services required to implement and sustain our neuroinformatics tools. This will include installation, support, training, and data storage among other things. The successful completion of this project would represent a major transformation which could propel scientific sharing and knowledge extraction of diverse types of data into a practical and widely used model. 2           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a great need for tools to easily share and disseminate data from brain imaging studies.

This STTR proposal extends and transfers the technology for quantitative assessment of 3D and 4D aortic image data from MR and MDCT, the resultsof recent NIH-funded research at the University of Iowa, to clinical applicability. No such analyses are currently commercially available for either assessment of connective tissue disorders using MR nor for MDCT-based assessment of atherosclerosis.

Although chronic use of small amounts of alcohol is not always harmful, heavier use (gt2 drinks/day) is generally harmful and frequently leadsto alcoholism-the most common forms being alcohol abuse (AA) and alcohol dependence (AD). AA/AD affect ~25% of the U.S. population and cause nearly  200 billion/yr of economic damage and untold human misery. These adverse outcomes are potentially avoidableif the alcohol abuse is spotted early; however, current screening methods for chronic alcohol use capture alcohol usage only in the hours prior to testing or rely on insensitive, non-specific protein assays. A next-generation method that could more reliably identify chronic alcohol abuse and monitor abstinence would be of great interest to a large number of groups, including medical, governmental, security and transportation agencies. Developing, validating, and commercializing such a next-generation technology is Behavioral Diagnostic&#039;s overall goal. In this Phase I feasibility study, we will build upon our extensive experience in substance use epigenetics and will seek to achieve two goals. First, we will unequivocally demonstrate that the overall patterns of methylation associated with alcohol use are reliable. Second, we will determine the stability of DNA methylation in the absence of immediate alcohol use. In this Phase I project, we propose to do this by first validating the results from a prior genome-wide analysis of alcohol associated DNA methylation changes by comparing the methylation profiles of abstinent controls with that of heavy drinkers admitted for acute detoxication. We will then follow these drinkers through a 30 day inpatient treatment stay and check methylation at the most significantly differentially methylated residues after 30 days of inpatient assured abstinence to determine which are stable (trait marker) and which start the process of reverting to the population mean (state markerand possible indicator of treatment associated abstinence). If successful, this project will be a significant advancement for the field and will serve as proof of principle for our Phase II development of a full-scale diagnostic tool for both the detectionand quantitation of chronic alcohol use and monitor abstinence in patients after discharge. This highly innovative proposal is significant because the development of easy to use, relatively foolproof diagnostic tests for these disorders could find widespread acceptance in medical, civil and forensic applications.

First, Dr. Philibert, is a co-inventor of the technology, is a board certified psychiatrist with extensive experience in all aspects of the proposed studies , and has direct capability of overseeing any potential Phase II of this study. Second, Dr. Osborn, the CEO, has thirty years of experience in bio-industry and is well connected to the biomedical and bioventure communities. Fourth, we are further aided by a team of ethicists and substance use specialists.

However, current treatment recommendations (treatment of underlying illness, improved nutrition and exercise if possible) are often woefully inadequate. Thus, aging-induced skeletal muscleatrophy represents an enormous unmet medical need and market worldwide. The overall goal of Emmyon, Inc. is to develop a pharmacologic therapy for aging-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. In preliminary studies, Emmyon&#039;s founders at the University of Iowa discovered two compounds that inhibit skeletal muscle atrophy in multiple mouse models. Both compounds are natural products found in edible plants (suggesting a favorable safety profile) and the robust effects of these compounds in mice suggest outstandingpotential as pharmacologic therapies for skeletal muscle atrophy. Data from one of the compounds, ursolic acid, has been published by Emmyon&#039;s founders, leading to widespread interest from the pharmaceutical and food industries. Emmyon&#039;s founders have notyet publically disclosed the identity of the second compound. Based on this research, the University of Iowa applied for use patents for both compounds in the treatment of aging-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. Emmyon, Inc. is in the final stages of negotiation for an exclusive license to this intellectual property. In this phase I SBIR study, Emmyon will begin to develop ursolic acid and the second compound as pharmacologic therapies for aging-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. Although both compounds reduceskeletal muscle atrophy during fasting, limb immobilization and muscle denervation, their effects in aging-induced skeletal muscle atrophy are not yet known. In the proposed studies, Emmyon will determine the feasibility of ursolic acid and the second compound as therapies for aging-induced skeletal muscle atrophy by administering both compounds to aged mice. Compound efficacy will be determined by measuring grip strength, skeletal muscle mass, skeletal muscle fiber size and molecular atrophy mediators. The study will also assess the effects of both compounds on fat mass, blood glucose and lipid levels, and liver and kidney function. Emmyon&#039;s goal is to identify at least one compound that reduces skeletal muscle atrophy in aged mice. In Phase II studies, Emmyon will develop formulations of one or both compounds and carry them to pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies, followed by IND application(s). Depending on potency and efficacy, one or both compounds could form the basis for pharmaceuticals or medicinalfoods. Initial clinical studies will be geared towards FDA approval for the prevention and treatment of skeletal muscle atrophy in the elderly.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In elderly patients, skeletal muscle wasting is acommon and serious problem, but lacks a medical therapy.

We have developed a group of proprietary bisphosphonates containing isoprene substructures that demonstrate highly potent and specific GGSI activity in vitro. These compounds do not contain the hydroxyl group or the nitrogen substructure of thecurrent bisphosphonates, which are used clinically. Our GGSIs represent a significant advance in bisphosphonate development in that they target a downstream enzyme relative to the clinical bisphosphonates. We feel that further development of our novel GGSIs for the treatment of osteoporosis is warranted based on the strength of our preliminary studies and the ongoing need for additional treatments for this disease which represents a significant and growing public health problem. Indeed, it is estimated thatby 2025 osteoporosis will result in  25 billion worth of health costs each year. Here we propose SBIR Phase I studies to prove the feasibility of GGSIs in osteoporosis in a commonly used rat model of the disease.  The feasibility studies described in thisproposal provide a streamlined approach towards identification of the most active GGSI towards bone resorption from our library using in vitro models, and transition of these active compounds into an in vivo model of bone resorption. In specific aim one we will use cell based models to prioritize our compounds based on osteoclast resorption activity and inhibition of osteoblast apoptosis. Then in specific aim two we will use the highest priority compound in an ovariectomized rat model of osteoporosis and correlate the in vitro data to in vivo measurements of bone strength, biomarkers of mechanism engagement, biomarkers of bone resorption, and ex vivo markers of osteoblast apoptosis.

In this proposal we advocate developing drugs based on inhibiting an unexploited biological process (protein geranylgeranylation) that is known to be important to processes in osteoporosis including osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Development of new targeted therapies for bone resorption could have a great impacton this patient population."

Currently, parathyroid hormone (PTH; FORTEOTM) and its analogs are the only bone building therapies available yet they capture only 8% of the osteoporosis market due to significant dosing and safety limitations. OsteoGeneX is developing the first-in-class orally available therapeutic that target the new validated bone building protein sclerostin (SOST gene) for the treatment of osteoporosis and related bone disorders. Using proteomic approaches Dr. Elies and Krumlauf discovered and patented sclerostin&#039;s mechanism of action (sclerostin binds to LRP to inhibit the Wnt pathway; Issued patent 11/985,836, herein attached). Dr. Ellies has over two decades of expertise on the role of Wnt in bone and her involvement in the development of sclerostin blocking antibodies has enriched her skills to now focus on developing small molecule sclerostin inhibitor therapeutics, as opposed to large bio-molecules, i.e. antibodies and proteins, at OsteoGeneX. Dr. Ellies and her team have identified lead candidates functioning to inhibit sclerostin action on  the Wnt pathway. In 2008, OsteoGeneX was awarded a SBIR Phase IIfrom NIH/NIAMS to further develop the Phase I concept to identify the efficacious dosing of validated lead candidates. OsteoGeneX has successfully found that three structurally distinct lead candidates are efficacious at building new bone in vivo. OsteoGeneX&#039;s strategy involves an early emphasis on drug safety to reduce lead/drug atrition later in the clinical development process. In so doing,  we are now taking the next step in drug development looking to identify the active functional core (pharmacophore) of three leads to allow us to then refine a lead compound that has an increased potency and decreased off-target effects (toxicity). The purpose of this SBIR application is to identify the sclerostin protein binding residues that our sclerostin small molecules interact with to enable the functional inhibition of sclerostin function and increase in bone density. Knowing the binding site will help facilitate efforts to develop and refine a safer more potent therapy to build bone for osteoporosis. At the completion of these proposed Phase I studies, OGXTM wil have selected a more potent and safe lead candidate and be primed to start preclinical efficacy studies. Once successful at demonstrating efficacy, then we would engage the FDA for an IND guidance meeting to discuss our IND strategy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The osteoporosis market is still in demand for new therapeutics due to the lack of safe orally available bone building drugs. Currently, parathyroid hormone (PTH; FORTEOTM) and its analogs are the only bone building therapies available yet capture only 8% of the osteoporosis market due to significant dosing and safety limitations. To this end and with a lifetime use limit of 24 months, FORTEO is administered by daily subcutaneous injections and carries an FDA black box warning due to the risk of osteosarcoma. Due to the risks and limitations associated with the only bone-building option currently available,  bone-loss inhibitors (biphosphonates, Fosamax(R)) capture 92% of this billion-dollar market. Of the available bone-loss inhibitor therapies and notwithstanding inconvenient dosing regimens that alleviate erosion of the esophagus, these therapies may cause osteoneicrosis of the jaw preventing any future dental work, higher frequency of atrial fibrillation, and more recently, fractures, the bisphophonate class constitutes 68% of the market share.. Clearly, there is a substantial unmet medical need for new, safe and orally available bone-building therapies. OsteoGeneX (OGX) is developing orally available first-in-class small molecules that have safety and dosing advantages over the only other bone-building therapy on the market, using the most specific bone building target available, sclerostin, which has been validated by Amgen.OGXTM bone building products will be used to treat all low bone mass conditions, and other bone-building needs (i.e. in spinal fusions, fracture repair, prosthetic anchoring). Ultimately, the useof OGXTM will result in decreased medical expenses and burdenby decreasing fracture incidence thereby leading to increased social benefit as quality of life will be enhanced."

Estimates of the frequency of post-cancer lymphedema range from 20%-90%, depending upon the metrics used to measure development of the condition. There is significant social and monetary cost associated with lymphedema, including increased healthcare costs associated with the increased susceptibility to infection in oedematous tissue. Over the past decade, a number of soluble factors and techniques have been described that promote regrowth of lymphatics in vivo, although appropriate delivery vehicles remain a challenge. Recently, a formulation containing recombinant VEGF-C was found to reduce lymphedema in an acute sheep model of secondary lymphedema. Additional studies demonstrated increased efficacy of lymphatic regeneration associated with lymph node autotransplantation in conjunction with VEGF-Cadministration in a rat model. Unfortunately, VEGF-C release occurred rapidly in both situations, which apparently reduced effectiveness. It is the goal of this proposal to define a delivery formulation which will release prolymphangiogenic factors in a controlled slow release, promoting lymphatic regeneration and reducing lymphedema. To accomplish this goal, we will (i) Define a novel formulation based on natural plant products for the controlled release of lymphangiogenic factors (ii) Test the biocompatibility of this formulation in cultured sheep lymphatic endothelial cells and (iii) Map th effects of this formulation in reducing lymphedema in a proven animal model of secondary lymphedema in conjunction with lymph node autotransplantation. We have partnered with a group with demonstrated expertise in the mechanisms and resolution of lymphedema to develop novel, slow-release delivery systems to treat lymphedema through regrowth of interrupted lymphatic vessels. This work will ultimately reduce post-treatment costs associated with breast cancer, and may be applied to other conditions to promote lymphatic regrowth and appropriate drainage of interstitial fluid.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radical mastectomy and sentinel node removal during breast cancer treatment may lead to development of secondary lymphedema in a significant number of patients. These complications can lead to extensive health- care costs, increased patient morbidity, and increased susceptibility to secondary infection. This proposal aims to use established mediators that promote lymphatic regrowth in conjunction with autologous lymph node transplantation, and hence reduce edema in a novel, biocompatible slow-delivery system to treat secondary lymphedema and alleviate these negative consequences to breast-cancer survivors."

However, methods are lacking to support the early diagnosis ofAKI that could lead to early intervention, improved therapy, better prognosis, and lower medical costs. For these reasons, the development of early diagnosis tools for AKI is one of the solicited research topics listed by the NIDDK.  Our ultimate goal isto develop a portable device for reliable early detection of AKI at point of care. The innovation of our proposal lies in the combination of aptamer technology with microcantilever detection of serum/urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL),an early marker of AKI [2-4 hours at the onset of AKI with cutoff concentration of ~ 150 ng/ml (6.8 nM)]. Aptamers are ssDNAs/RNAs that bind their targets avidly and specifically, and are selected in vitro by Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponentialenrichment (SELEX). For biosensor development, aptamers have many advantages over antibodies, including their smaller size, amenability to chemical synthesis and modifications and adaptability to a broad range of assay formats including a microcantileverdetection system. A microcantilever is a beam, often of silicon, that is 1-5  m thick and 500-100  m long and anchored only at one end. The microcantilever bends when its surface stress changes due to the conformation change that occurs upon ligand-receptor (e.g. aptamer-target) interaction on its surface. The differential surface stress between a reference cantilever coated with a scrambled nucleic acid that does not bind the analyte and a sensing cantilever coated with an aptamer that binds the analyte ismeasured by interferometry. In this phase I study, we propose two specific aims:  1. Identify 2&#039;F-modified aptamers that bind NGAL specifically with nanomolar affinity.  2. Demonstrate an aptamer-functionalized microcantilever device for NGAL detection.In phase I, we expect to develop a prototype of an aptamer-functionalized microcantilever that will be responsive to NGAL, which will be further optimized in phase II for reliable performance with serum and urine samples with robust signal/noise ratio, sensitivity, detection limit and dynamic range of measurement and that can be used at point of care to monitor for AKI.

Group-housed rodents are better able to cope with stress through improved behavioral and physiological responses. Unfortunately, many experiments, including those designed to measure behavior, circadian activity, and/or sleep, necessitate single-housing due to technological restrictions. Automated delivery of an experimental intervention, such as gentle nudging to disturb sleep, is easily accomplished with single animals but is complicated in group-housing environments. The overall goal of this application is (1) to develop a novel cage enclosure designed for group housing of multiple, physically similar animals with long-term computer-aided video monitoring and radio frequency identification (RFID) to correctly and accurately identify and track individual animals within a group of three or more and (2) to automatically apply an intervention stimulus to one or more animals within the group. This system will employ a robotic arm situated directly above the cage, which, when tied to the video tracking module and RFID reader, can selectively apply an intervention stimulus (i.e., gentle nudging for sleep deprivation) to a specific animal based on state-specific feedback. The defined state may be classified using data collected via video tracking, wireless electroencephalograph (EEG) measurement, wireless biosensor measurement of specific neurochemicals, or other wireless physiological measurements. The system will be configurable so that the intervention stimulus may be applied to an individual animal based on physiological parameters defined by the researcher. In Phase I of this application,we will design and test a prototype enclosure for individual animal identification and stimulus in a small group of rats. Phase II will continue this development by testing and refining animal tracking and behavior involving multiple rats and mice, increasing the accuracy of video tracking, and increasing the types of intervention stimuli available to the researcher. At the completion of Phase II, we will have a complete, turn-key hardware and software solution that will be commercially available to the research community.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to give researchers a new tool to overcome social isolation stressors in their experiments and can be used across many different research models. For example, the system can be used to eliminate the unwanted effects of social isolation on sleep deprivation and sleep fragmentation studies helping an estimated 40 million Americans who suffer from chronic, long-term sleep disorders and the 20 million who experience occasional sleeping problems. Poor sleep alone accounts for an estimated  16 billion in medical costs each year and the indirect costs of lost productivity and other factors are known to be much higher."

The user base for this technology continues to increase due to the growth of the field of cognitive neuroscience, and this increase is poised to accelerate with adoption of fMRI to large-scale multi-site studies, translational studies, and clinical trials. In order to observe functionally relevant neural responses, it is necessary to conduct experiments in which brain activity is measured while audio/visual stimuli are presented, and behavioral responses are recorded. Further, the software controlling these behavioral experiments must be carefully synchronized with the functioning of the MR scanner itself. Thus, building capacity for fMRI research involves a massive investment in infrastructure for specialized hardware for audio/visual stimulus presentation, behavioral response recording and synchronization of these devices with the MR equipment. And yet, the criticalinterface between this infrastructure and the software that controls the behavioral experiments, that are the core of the functional assessments in fMRI, is often ad hoc, complicated to use and prone to failure. This creates time-consuming and expensive difficulties at multiple stages of the development and execution of studies, and creates a set of technical problems that are outside the core capabilities and training of the physicists, radiologists and technicians responsible for managing, running and maintaining the MR center. We propose to create a universal software/hardware interface that will dramatically streamline the development and implementation of studies at existing fMRI research sites. The device will provide a sturdy, fixed,  standardized, flexible and intuitive interface between a wide variety of experimental control software and all widely used MR systems. Once a minimal viable product is developed, we will test its efficacy in an active fMRI research center.

Contemporary mobile devices are capable of highly engaging and millisecond accurate stimulus presentation, reaction time measurements, and remote data retrieval. Yet despite these capabilities, their potential as a research tool remains largely unrealized because there is no existing end-to-end solution for conducting behavioral research. The proposed Paradigm for Mobile platform will be the first complete stimulus presentation system for mobile devices suitable for millisecond accurate biobehavioral research. Our platform will enable scientists to create engaging, portable, and millisecond accurate experiments and assessments for a wide range of basic and clinical research. For example, in developmental research, the platform&#039;s ability to use the more naturalistic responses available on these devices (e.g. shake, spin, and swipe) will help address issues of task completion in age groups such as toddlers whose limited motor coordination and attention span prohibit the use of traditional desktop computer-based experiments. The platform&#039;s flexibility, accuracy and low cost will also allow it to serve as a replacement for expensive and inflexible neurocognitive assessment tools often used in clinical research. Further, it will offer the ability to securely upload experiment results to a  cloud  based storage  system and issue repeated reminders to participants making it well-suited for remote data collection. For example, in large-scale longitudinal studies, which are often conducted over wide geographical areas, the platform will be able to facilitate self-administered assessments. In Phase I we will develop a prototype of the platform (Aim 1) that is able to run experiments in Apple&#039;s iOS environment (for iPhone, iPod and iPad). We will demonstrate the platform&#039;s timing accuracy using a comprehensive suite of benchmarks which, when published, will be the first study to measure the timing capabilities and suitability of mobile devices for use in the biobehavioral sciences (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct  real world  tests of our prototype by running small-scale studies with preschoolers and adults in two different NIH funded laboratories (Aim 3). These studies will allow us to characterize the overall suitability and performance of our prototype, establishing a foundation for further development and broader device support in Phase II. The commercialization of this system would have a broad impact on biobehavioral research by improving the quality and quantity of data collected from key populations, and enabling new modes of continuous, longitudinal data collection.

It is part ofa group of lysosomal storage disorders - the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) - that together constitute the most common neurodegenerative diseases of childhood. JNCL is a devastating disease that results in vision loss, motor and cognitive deficits,seizures, autoimmune irregularities, and premature death. Currently there is no cure for JNCL, and treatments are limited to alleviating symptoms of disease. The development of improved therapies for JNCL is currently limited by the lack of an animal modelthat accurately recreates the multi-systemic nature of this disease. Several mouse models of JNCL have been developed via targeted disruption of the murine Cln3 gene, and these models have been valuable for understanding CLN3 function and JNCL disease. However, none of the mouse models fully replicate the complex clinical manifestations observed in the human disease, and more importantly, none develop the severe neurological phenotype that is the hallmark of human JNCL disease. This is likely the result ofspecies differences in physiology, anatomy, and development. In contrast, pigs may serve as a better model in which to study JNCL because of their similarity to humans. Pigs have long been used to model human diseases and are being studied as a source oforgans for human xenotransplantation. Because the development and anatomy of the porcine brain more closely resembles that of humans than mice, mutations in the porcine CLN3 gene may result in many of the same neurological changes that are observed in patients with JNCL. The similarities of the porcine visual system offer advantages for modeling the vision phenotype, as well. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a porcine model of JNCL by disrupting the CLN3 gene. We intend to accomplish this in two steps by combining gene-targeting and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). This proposal outlines the development of porcine fibroblasts with mutated CLN3 alleles. Gene targeting vectors will be developed to delete exons 7 and 8 (the mostcommon mutation in JNCL patients) from both copies of the endogenous CLN3 gene. Porcine fetal fibroblasts will be infected with a virus carrying the CLN3 targeting vector. Our plans for generating properly targeted cells are designed to maximize the frequency of homologous recombination, minimize random integration, and minimize the number of cell passages before targeted cells are harvested. A subsequent project will use these cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce CLN3-targeted pigs followed by characterization and validation activities. The JNCL porcine model will provide academic and industry researchers an opportunity to better understand the consequences of CLN3 dysfunction and the pathogenesis of JNCL, and to develop and test new therapeutic and preventative strategies.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal specifically outlines the development of porcine fibroblasts with mutated CLN3 alleles as a first step towards a new model of human juvenile neuronalceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL), also known as Batten disease. Subsequent work will use these cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce JNCL pigs that will then be characterized and validated as an appropriate model. This project is relevant to the NIH&#039;s mission because it will provide a resource to stimulate discovery and the development of new therapeutic applications."

Nicotine is singularly responsible for the dependence-forming properties of tobacco smoking and, once introduced to the body, affects the brain within 15 seconds.Breaking nicotine addiction is challenging and relapse rates remain high. The extremely rapid timescale of nicotine action renders existing techniques for studying nicotine accumulation in the brain (e.g., microdialysis, PET, radioimmunoassay) ill-suited for addiction studies in freely moving animals. Biosensors are a proven technology for monitoring real-time changes in CNS neurochemical concentrations on a second-by-second basis. The overall goal of this proposal is the delivery of a biosensor that can detect nicotine in a freely moving animal at relevant in vivo concentrations and that is compatible with Pinnacle&#039;s existing turn-key systems. The most critical component of a biosensor is the enzyme used as the biorecognition element, and no aspect of a biosensor&#039;s final design is as vital as a properly folded enzyme with sufficient activity and stability profiles. In Phase I, we were highly successful in providing proof-of-concept for two critical components of the nicotine biosensor: (1) conversion of 6-hydroxynicotine oxidase into an oxidase with an enhanced kcat for nicotine (~0.2 sec-1) while maintaining a Km that is 1000-fold above expected in vivo concentrations, and (2) development of new, thinner membranes to support nicotine monitoring. We also successfully implemented a random selection and screening strategy that gave rise to new mutations that enhanced the performance characteristics of the engineered nicotine oxidase enzyme. Phase II will complete the nicotine enzyme optimization through ongoingdirected evolution of the nicotine oxidase enzyme. We will also continue the ongoing optimization of new films to improve biosensor sensitivity. The completion of this proposal will provide two important innovations to the scientific community: 1) A nicotine biosensor suitable for addiction studies that provides second-by-second changes of nicotine concentration in the CNS. 2) A refined approach for the development of new biosensors that target analytes important for addiction and for which no oxidase enzyme currently exists (i.e., cocaine and caffeine). Pinnacle will work in conjunction with an interdisciplinary consortium of leading scientists at the University of Kansas. When completed, this will be the first commercial biosensor specifically designed torecord nicotine in rodents and will represent the first commercialized biosensor for in vivo use that is based on an engineered oxidase enzyme for an analyte for which no enzyme previously existed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 50% of regular smokers die due to smoking-related complications. In addition, nicotine addiction associated with cigarette smoking takes a tremendous economic toll, costing the United States nearly  200 billion annually, including  97 billionin lost productivity and  96 billion in health care expenditures. This projec allows for a better understanding of nicotine addiction, which could advance smoking cessation research and potentially reduce 450,000 smoking-related deaths per year in the United States."

Concurrent role shifts in world economies (e.g., competition for seafood products with China) make it necessary for aquaculture to grow at a pace much faster than previously estimated. In addition, the American seafood trade deficit now exceeds $10 billion per year. Clearly, we are at a point when new technologies are desperately needed to aquaculture food production. It is clear that future aquaculture expansion cannot rely on resources which are static at best - if not declining - as is the case of fishmeal. Soybean meal (SBM) is an excellent source of dietary protein. However, possible SBM inclusion levels in fish/shrimp feeds are limited due to the presence of both heat-resistant and thermo-labile anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) in SBM. While solvent-extracting and cooking significantly reduce the biological activity of protease inhibitors, this processing also renders protein less available for absorption at the intestinal level. Likewise, the preparation of soy protein concentrates (SPC) uses ethanol (or acid) percolation to displace soluble/indigestible carbohydrates (oligosaccharides) but, in doing so it also drives out minerals and vitamins of which SBM is considered a rich source. Moreover, the use of heated alcohol further denatures protein reducing solubility/dispersibility values (indicative of a diminished protein bioavailability). Recent advances in soy breeding have allowed for the development of non-genetically modified cultivars with enhanced nutritional characteristics. Reduced trypsin inhibitors, reduced oligosaccharides and high protein are traits that have been achieved with more improvements being constantly developed. Building on progress to date we have tested several unconventional, not-thermal (energy-saving), nutrient-preserving treatments to process aquafeed-oriented soybean cultivars into novelty meals. The proposed work will quantify - in Atlantic salmon, hybrid striped bass, tilapia and Pacific white shrimp - the effects of using these novel ingredients on waste generation and water quality of recirculating culture systems. Measurable quantities of waste materials generated by fish fed diets based on conventional SBM, SPC and/or fismeal will be contrasted with those produced by fish fed the test ingredients. Apparent digestibility coefficients, fish performance indicators, gut histology and changes in enteric populations of bacteria will be evaluated as well. We envision that the synergy between enhanced soybean cultivars processed under unconventional non-thermal methods will allow for higher inclusion rates in fish/shrimp feed formulations resulting in increased sales of American soy products worldwide. The production of alternative, soy-based aquafeeds will have a significant and positive impact in American aquaculture as well as on American seafood supply and availability."

Increased demand for fish protein and reduced wild captured fish has facilitated rapid growth of aquaculture (9% per year). This has dramatically increased demand for fish meal (the primary component in aquaculture feeds), causing overexploitation of this resource and rapidly escalating prices. There is considerable market opportunity for a high quality, economical plant protein concentrate to completely replace fish meal in aquaculture feeds, thus providing broad impact. The proposed innovation is a microbially-based process to economically produce HQSPC by converting soybean carbohydrates into protein, yield an exopolysaccharide for pellet binding, and provide an immunoprophylactic. Phase II objectives include generating sufficient quantities of HQSPC for feeding trials with yellow perch to assess technical and economic feasibility. The HQSPC is anticipated to have>70% protein to replace fish meal, while providing desirable growth rates and conversion efficiencies. Bench-scale production costs should be less than current SPC ($0.30/lb), but with an intrinsic value closer to that of soy protein isolate ($1.50/lb). The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to improve the nation?s second largest trade deficit for natural resources, fish protein, by providing a complete fish meal replacement. Soybean meal or soy protein concentrates (SPC) have been used to partially replace fish meal, however the solvent extraction process used to produce SPC is expensive, the separated oligosaccharides do not have a valuable use, and the quality of SPC (65% protein) is insufficient to permit complete replacement of fish meal. Soy protein isolate (90% protein) requires a more costly protein extraction method. The proposed microbial process converts soybean carbohydrates into additional protein, along with sufficient gum to serve as a binding agent, and a probiotic to induce an immunostimulant effect. Preliminary data shows the proposed microbe will metabolize the individual carbohydrates in soybeans, which will enhance scientific and technological understanding of this mechanism. To demonstrate technical and commercial feasibility, extrusion and enzymatic saccharification will be used to solubilize carbohydrates in soybean white flake, followed by incubation with the gum producing microbe, and recovery of solids for use in yellow perch feeding trials. International aquaculture feed manufacturers would be prospective customers for the HQSPC or the conversion process itself."

DAVinCI is a collaborative, guided inquiry environment and game targeted for grades 9-12. This concept will integrate aerospace vehicle design and simulation tools with a design challenge-based game inspired by real world engineering problems. The environment is intended to be a hybrid of self-directed informal learning and software that can support in-class projects and topics and/or be utilized by students outside of class. Students will be guided through the required background in science, mathematics and engineering principles and encouraged to explore and utilize these principles in vehicle design. Engaging pre-college students with engineering design methodology is one way to advance Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and increase the number of STEM college graduates. Aerospace vehicle design in particular is a powerful, versatile exciting platform to expose students to many facets of science and engineering, as it is truly a multidisciplinary endeavor. The anticipated Phase I results are beta tests of a proof-of-concept engineering design game containing a full chapter of content and design challenges. The broader impact and commercial potential of this project is a game that fills a niche for Grade 9-12 for engineering education. There are a number of planned avenues for initial commercialization, including sales to schools, parents, and of auxiliary features such as expansion packs and hobby kits. Future commercial opportunities will include stand-alone design-based games, design environments for hobbyists, and model generation tools for flight simulators. Engineering design promotes added interconnectivity and enrichment in STEM education. Improved connection to practical applications could also improve student performance in the sciences, technology, and mathematics. If successful, DAVinCI would be an excellent way to inspire students to consider careers in the sciences and engineering at formative points in their education. While there are numerous commercial software products to assist with the learning and teaching of science, technology, and mathematics, there are few products that attempt to address engineering education, and even fewer that attempt to do so in a largely informal manner that integrates game mechanics and design methodology. The tight integration of the design and game environments maintains the engagement of students to support classroom activities and continue reinforcement of concepts outside of class."

DHA is important for maintaining good health and is in serious supply shortage worldwide. Metabolic engineering will be used to increase DHA production in Moritella marina, which naturally produces DHA. This will be accomplished by deletion of competing metabolic pathways to increase expression of the DHA-producing pathway. The goal is to increase production such that the overall DHA titer is 1.0 g/L. This work also will provide insight into control of central metabolic flux and sensing and control of fatty acid content and production. Thus, the intellectual merit of this work extends to a variety of metabolic products. The broader impact/commercial impact of this project is the development of an alternative production system for DHA, a sustainable and safe nutraceutical that is in serious supply shortage worldwide. Data suggest that omega-3 fatty acids, such as DHA, play important roles in enhancing heart health, brain health, child and infant development and preventing various chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, obesity and type-2 diabetes. It is recommended that the general public consume at least 100-1000 mg of PUFA daily; the current primary source for DHA is from cold water fish, which cannot meet global demand. The commercial goal is to biomanufacture DHA, and then market a DHA-enriched oil to nutritional supplement and food manufacturers to meet the growing demand for this product."

Conventional back reflectors consist of a sputtered metal film, which requires high capital cost for large scale systems and frequent downtime due to maintenance, cleaning, and replacing of the sputtering targets. In addition, sputtered metal back reflectors can have adverse effects on the solar cell device. Solar cells with silver back reflectors can achieve record efficiencies, but silver migrates into the absorber material and deteriorates the performance and reliability. Further, silver does not adhere well to substrates used in solar cell manufacturing and readily oxidizes reducing its reflectivity. Instead, sputtered aluminum back reflectors are typically used in thin film solar industry, but aluminum absorbs light in a crucial portion of the sunlight spectrum resulting in moderate performance gains. This project will use the lower-cost electrophoretic deposition method to grow dielectric nanoparticle thin films. The anticipated result is a manufacturable nanoparticle back reflector that is equally as reflective as silver for high efficiency and reliable solar cells. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to produce high efficiency thin film solar cells using nanoparticle-based back reflectors. The proposed nanoparticle-based back reflector can be fabricated using the atmospheric electrophoretic deposition method and replaces the conventional approach of using high vacuum sputtering of metals, which can be expensive, time consuming, energy intensive, and have poor material utilization. Engineered nanoparticle-based films are an ideal way to obtain very high light scattering and reflective surfaces, which are required properties of back reflectors in high efficiency solar cells. A combination of high solar cell performance and low-cost manufacturing methods means that the proposed nanoparticle-based back reflector will be well positioned to succeed in a highly competitive solar market, which had sales of $82 billion in 2010. Beyond solar, additional applications for highly engineered nanoparticle-based films include backlight reflectors for high efficiency flat panel displays, superhydrophobic surfaces for self-cleaning and water shedding applications, textured/porous structures for electronic devices, and photonic structures for electro-optical devices. This project will promote technology-based economic development in the upper Midwest. Collaboration with South Dakota State University will train graduate and undergraduate students in nanomaterial science and engineering to advance the capabilities of the future workforce."

Manmade noise, unintentional as well as intentional, is a ubiquitous and rapidly growing source of interference with various electronic devices, systems, and services, harmfully affecting their physical, commercial, and operational properties. This noise comes from a magnitude of various sources such as mutual interference of multiple devices combined in a system (for example, a smartphone equipped with WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, and many other devices), electrical equipment and electronics in home and office, dense urban and industrial environments, increasingly crowded wireless spectrum, and intentional jamming. The proposed nonlinear algorithms and circuits, Adaptive Nonlinear Differential Limiters (ANDLs), have many significant advantages over existing filtering solutions, providing capabilities that cannot be replicated by linear filtering devices and systems. ANDLs also enable elegant and inexpensive real-time solutions to the manmade interference problems that may be used in addition, or as a low-cost alternative, to the state-of-art interference mitigation methods. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in its ability to advance scientific and technological understanding of the problems caused by manmade interference, as the proposed ANDL algorithms and circuits enable a variety of simplified and inexpensive real-time solutions to these problems, further enhancing the societal and commercial impact of the proposed technology. ANDLs are intended to be fully compatible with existing linear devices and systems, and to be used in addition, or as a low-cost alternative, to the state-of-art interference mitigation methods.

High-quality science teaching tools are needed because the US is ranked 17th in science education among developed nations (PISA 2009), which may be in part due to lack of teacher training in science (Roehrig et al. 2011). The proposed video game will allow teachers, regardless of science background, to create customizable microhabitats (i.e., islands) with different geographical features. Players will be prompted to use observation and experimentation to determine the optimal combinations of organisms that will thrive in their virtual world. The game will encourage players to ask questions, experiment, analyze, and solve problems in an interactive virtual environment. The aim of this project is to enhance children&#039;s natural curiosity while teaching them scientific reasoning, and to develop in them analytical process and thinking skills necessary for solving multiple-variable real-world problems. The development of these skills will ultimately promote interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) professions. The broader/commercial impact is increasing student interest in STEM professions by filling a market niche that is currently empty: ecology-themed video games for elementary school students. In a technically competitive world, U.S. educational systems must aggressively focus on teaching our youngest to understand and use scientific thinking. Local teachers, children, and parents will work with our programmers to have significant input into the game design. It is crucial to consider the difficulties that elementary educators face when teaching science, since teachers will take the lead in presenting this game to their students in the classroom. Furthermore, the video game will offer a way for schools that may not have ready access to outdoor areas (e.g., urban schools who enroll a disproportionately large number of minority students underrepresented in STEM professions) to conduct hands-on experimentation and to design and test ecological experiments in a virtual environment. There are currently no video games on the market that teach elementary school students ecological concepts while training them to think like a scientist. This lack of commercial competition, paired with a need for additional science resources in schools, indicates a commercial market opportunity for this video game."

Existing solutions cannot be widely adopted due to their high costs and disruptive operations. This SBIR Phase I project leverages novel underground communication techniques developed as part of an NSF CAREER award to commercialize smart irrigation management solutions and validate business hypotheses. An underground communication system was innovated based on empirical and theoretical underground communication models. The resulting underground communication design is employed to provide communication ranges of up to 85m from an underground sensor to a center pivot irrigation system. Accordingly, this SBIR Phase I project focuses on two main research topics: (1) Error Control: An adaptive error control scheme is devised to provide reliable communication under varying environmental conditions and (2) Sampling Scheduling: Effective soil moisture sampling scheduling algorithms are developed to improve the lifetime of an underground sensor network and minimize operational costs. Based on these innovations, the devised systems will feed real-time soil information into irrigation management systems for improved crop for drop. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant in facilitating more efficient irrigation management technologies through real-time soil information provided by wireless underground sensors. Currently, 40% of the world&#039;s food is produced by irrigated agriculture, and 70% of all available water is used for agriculture irrigation. The increasing demand for food and the emerging scarcity in freshwater resources increase market demand for more efficient water management tools to improve crop per drop. Out of the 56.8M-acre of irrigated farm lands in the US, about 53.7% (30.5M acres) are irrigated by center pivot systems with 8.5M acre irrigated land in Nebraska. Proper irrigation management will help prevent economic losses caused by over- or under-irrigation; movement of nutrients, pesticides and other chemicals into the groundwater and other water bodies; and wasting water resources and energy consumption. The novel wireless underground communication techniques reduce the operation costs significantly compared to existing systems. Accordingly, farmers can make better-informed irrigation application (timing) decisions without the need for tools that obstruct field operations, thereby significantly reducing costs and improving water efficiency. The developed wireless underground communication solutions will have significant impacts on the commercial development of systems that operate in confined environments."

Simplification of operating process of 3D cell culture and reduction of hydrogel synthesis cost will greatly advance this technology to be used routinely for both academic and industry. Drug discovery and regenerative medicine development will be benefited from this high throughput screening and better in vivo representative cell culture system and extent to affect the pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and life sciences industries, which possess over $1,001.5 billion global market.

The MSND technology resulted in over 40 publications, three allowed patents, one patent pending, and recently received an R & amp;D 100 award in 2009.  The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) requires a variety of neutron detectors for their beam port instruments. Three specific instruments need high spatial resolution thermal-neutron detector arrays that are presently not commercially available. The VULCAN Engineering Diffractometer, the TOPAZ crystal diffractometer, and the liquid reflectometer all need thermal-neutron detecting arrays capable of 100 micron spatial resolutions. Furthermore, the devices must be insensitive to gamma rays while retaining high thermal-neutron intrinsic detection efficiency, preferably above 30%. A last requirement is that the neutron-imaging detectors must have a relatively fast response-time, namely, less than 10 microseconds.  The microstructured neutron detector technology developed in a previous NSF CED phase of the IMR-MIP program can fulfill the stringent requirements laid forth by instrument scientists at the SNS. Compact neutron detectors with high counting efficiency and low voltage operation were fabricated by etching micro-cavity patterns into a semiconductor diode. These microscopic patterns were backfilled with 6LiF, a neutron conversion material.  Neutron interactions in the 6LiF converter cause the spontaneous emission of energetic charged particles which are subsequently detected in the adjacent semiconductor diode walls. The deep trenches backfilled with neutron reactive material increases the neutron absorption efficiency, and for devices with narrow trenches, the probability of registering the energetic reaction products is dramatically increased. These detectors were fashioned into prototype linear arrays. Further, special readout ASICs were designed and built, along with the supporting electronics, to couple this small array to the existing infrastructure at the SNS. In the present SBIR/STTR phase I proposal, a 64-channel unit of a full high-resolution, high-efficiency 3000-pixel linear neutron detector array will be constructed. The long term phase II goal will be a 3000 pixel array. Each pixel will have 100 micron spatial resolution and approximately 30% intrinsic thermal-neutron detection efficiency. Further, the new design has no dead space or neutron streaming paths, hence preventing loss of data at locations between pixels.  The proposed project is aggressive and will push the state-of-the-art for neutron scatter imaging to new levels. Successful completion of this project will produce the highest spatial resolution linear array to date. Further, the new technology will deliver compact, high-efficiency, thermal- neutron detectors capable of real-time neutron measurements; such devices currently do not exist.  Dr. Steven Bellinger, has 7 years of experience with the design and fabrication  of  microstructured  semiconductor  neutron  detectors,  and  presently  holds  the  record  for intrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency at 42%. Timothy Sobering, who will be consulted to design the improved readout electronics, has over 25 years of experience producing electronics for detector data acquisition and designed the prototype electronics for the first MSND neutron scattering detector."

Fast ultra wideband (UWB) and high power microwave (HPM) signals are not successfully blocked by most current protection technologies.      The Phase I work demonstrated a quasi-passive, solid state electro-optic terminal protection system (EOTPS) to effectively block UWB and HPM signals from the front end of radar systems.  The device uses power from the incoming transient to switch the signal line to ground.  Because the system as a whole requires no external power other than the transient, it can be considered a passive device.  Inherent delay in the system permits the switch to become fully conductive before the transient arrives, effectively creating a system with a negative switching time.  This allows the entire transient to be reflected, in contrast to other high power terminal protection techniques which allow part of the transient to reach the LNA.    The Phase II proposal presents a plan to further develop the performance of the EOTPS for higher frequencies and to coordinate with two prime contractors in developing test validation procedures to integrate this technology into BMDS architectures."

is routine. In addition, rotorcraft engineers traditionally use the wind tunnel to evaluate and finalize designs. Correlation between wind tunnel results and flight tests, when not good, have been often attributed in part to uncertainty in blockage corrections. Estimation of rotor blockage is significantly more complex than bluff body corrections as the correction depends on operational characteristics such 
as rotor RPM and thrust produced.

This proposal offers to develop an Integrated Design Environment (IDE) which can simulate a complete rotorcraft with or without wind tunnel walls including all the facility effects.

At the heart of the innovation are:

1. An automated hybrid grid generator. (viscous grids near the bodies and 
unstructured Cartesian grid everywhere else)
2. A robust and economical incompressible flow solver for the entire system of grids.
3. Momentum source based rotor model that is suitable and economical 
for simulating configurations with multiple rotors.

In Phase I, the proof-of-concept developed used unstructured Cartesian 
grid for the model and wind tunnel.

In phase II, the tool will be extended to hybrid grid with viscous grid near solid surfaces and will include several tools including a simple CAD like geometry manipulation tool and pre- and post-processing tools all integrated in one environment to facilitate ease of use."

Shorter door-to-door trip times require an increased usage of rotary wing and runway independent V/STOL technology.  One of the limiting factors to the increased adoption of this technology for providing feeder service to major hubs is the limited understanding of high-volume terminal area operations.Several important issues are associated with rotary wing and runway independent V/STOL aircraft, including severe aerodynamic interactions during take-off, transition and landing. There is also the possibility that the aero-acoustic environment generated in the terminal area may cause damage to buildings, unsafe working conditions for ground personnel, or unacceptable noise levels to surrounding communities.The success of commercial V/STOL transportation is predicated on being able to establish technical feasibility, societal acceptance and economic viability. The proposed aero-acoustic tool for terminal area operations offers a simulation capability to design engineers to make informed decisions based on technical (operations and handling near a terminal), societal (acoustic footprint) and economic considerations (performance) that includes the interactional aerodynamics between the aircraft and its surroundings. The designers and operators of rotary wing and V/STOL aircrafts will use the tool to evaluate, enhance and implement more efficient and safe terminal area operation guidelines.Phase I will develop the proof-of-concept of the simulation tool and use a tilt-rotor and a candidate terminal under different wind conditions to demonstrate its usefulness.

Long-term occupational exposure to these highly toxic drugs presents serious health risks (e.g., cancers, infertility, miscarriages, birth defects, spontaneous abortions, and congenital malformations) to over 5.5 million healthcare workers who are exposed to chemotherapy drugs each year. Liquid, particulate, or vapor leakage can occur during any of several steps in the process of compounding the drug and administering it to the patient, and several studies suggest the potential for workplace contamination is widespread. Closed system drug-transfer devices (CSTDs) were originally developed tomitigate these risks, but the devices now on the market suffer from key shortcomings, including leakage, needle sticks, inefficiencies, difficulty of use, and increased risk of repetitive stress injuries and compounding/delivery errors. Corvida&#039;s technology objective is to develop and commercialize a proprietary suite of medical devices that improve the safety of working environments for healthcare professionals and enhance the efficacy of patient treatments. Phase I successfully proved feasibility of theCorvida approach and the potential to overcome the limitations of current devices that leave healthcare workers unprotected. The Phase II goal is to fully validate this new CSTD with extensive testing and optimization. Phase II includes three aims to drivedevelopment of the Corvida CSTD and provide superior protection to healthcare workers. In Aim 1, the CSTD will be validated for design and production quality via published bench-top testing standards, including fluorescein sodium (UV solution) and titanium tetrachloride (visible vapor) tests. These tests will ensure that  the CSTD meets or exceeds all relevant USP and ISO standards to validate that it achieves the intended design and production quality for performance and functionality as well as packagingand sterilization. In Aim 2, the CSTD will be tested to demonstrate that it achieves containment and maintains sterility under end-user process simulation conditions using naproxen sodium and trypticase soy broth. In Aim 3, end-users will use the CorvidaCSTD to conduct compounding and simulated administration tasks (no drugs will be delivered to patients) in multiple pharmacy settings using two well established chemotherapy marker drugs: cyclophosphamide and fluorouracil. The Aim 3 study includes assessment of environmental surface contamination using analytic methods and will provide documentation of any device failures. An independent, certified industrial hygienist will collect and analyze wipe samples from  designated surfaces to assess pre-and-post-CSTD contamination. Iterative design will be utilized as needed to refine the CSTD system to meet all success criteria. As envisioned-and based on the very promising Phase I results-upon completion of Phase II the Corvida CSTD will be the first to meet the NIOSH and USP CSTD definition, and the Corvida device will have been validated against all ISO standards and FDA requirements, culminating in 510(k) market clearance and enabling successful commercialization.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Millions of healthcare workers are at risk of exposure to hazardous drugs, such as chemotherapeutics used to treat cancer patients, during drug preparation and administration. Closed system transfer devices (CSTDs) were originally developed with the goal of protectingworkers from the hazards of exposure to highly toxic drugs, but current devices have several shortcomings. This proposal describes an innovative design and approach for a new type of disposable CSTD that will provide better protection for healthcare workers and cancer patients alike, achieved by limiting the release of these hazardous drugs into the work environment."

If the islets can  be replaced, as with transplantation, then diabetes can be reversed.Human islets have limited utility because of a severe shortage of donors and the need for constant immune suppression to prevent rejection. Pigs could provide an unlimited supply of islets but the rejection would be even more vigorous, necessitating greater immune suppression.     Ximerex, Inc. has developed an innovative and proprietary technology known as surrogate tolerogenesis (ST). With ST pig islets can be transplanted without rejection or immune suppression. ST is supported by extensive proof of principle, including pig islets to diabetic monkey transplants with prolonged survival and function without immune suppression.     The program was recently reviewed by the NIH commercialization assistance program (CAP). A large panel of experts in business development concluded that the technology does provide a strong competitive advantage and is protected by a robust patent portfolio. However, the regulatory hurdles are substantial, requiring FDA approval for commercialization. Ximerex, Inc. is unlikely to attract private investments until the FDA allows phase I/II trails. Many specific suggestions were made.

It is characterized primarily by early onset cerebellar ataxia andtelangiectasia, from which the disease name is derived. In addition, patients also exhibit a number of other clinical symptoms including increased susceptibility to cancer (lymphomas, leukemia, brain tumors), immunodeficiency, insulin-resistant diabetes, chromosomal instability, sensitivity to ionizing radiation, susceptibility to bronchopulmonary disease, and the absence, or almost complete absence, of a thymus. Current treatments for A-T are directed toward the management of symptoms. Physical and speechtherapy can improve the lives of patients, and  -globulin injections can be given to support the immune system. However, no treatment is directed at the underlying defect. Consequently, A-T remains a fatal disease. The development of improved therapies forA-T is currently limited by the lack of an animal model that fully, and accurately, recapitulates the multi-systemic nature of this disease. A number of mouse models of A-T have been developed over the years by the targeted disruption of the mouse Atm gene, and these models have proved invaluable for studying some aspects of ATM function and A-T disease. However, no single mouse model fully replicates the complex clinical symptoms observed in human disease, and more importantly, none of the murine models develop the severe neurological phenotype that is the hallmark of human A-T disease. The failure of mouse models to develop the classical symptoms of A-T is likely the result of physiological, anatomical, and developmental differences between the two species. In contrast, pigs may serve as a better model in which to study human disease given that their development, anatomy, and physiology are more closely related to that of humans. Given that the development and anatomy of the pig brain more closely resembles that of humans than mice, mutations in the porcine ATM gene may result in many of the same neurological changes that are observed in A-T patients. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop and commercialize a porcine model of A-T by disrupting the ATM gene. We intend to accomplish this in two steps by combining gene-targeting and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). In this proposal, ATM+/- fetal fibroblasts that  were developed in Phase I will be used as nuclear donors for somatic cellnuclear transfer. Nuclear transfer embryos will be transferred to recipient females for gestation. Resulting piglets will have one targeted ATM gene. We will breed heterozygotes to produce ATM-/- pigs and perform a thorough molecular, biochemical, and physiological characterization. Finally, we will establish long-term breeding herds. This project is intended to produce a porcine model of ataxia-telangiectasia that will provide academic and industry researchers with an opportunity to better understand theconsequences of ATM dysfunction, the pathogenesis of A-T disease, and provide an improved model in which to develop and test new therapeutic strategies.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal specifically outlines the development, initial characterization, and propagation of genetically engineered porcine model of the human disease, ataxia-telangiectasia. This project is relevant to the NIH&#039;s mission because it will provide a resource to stimulate discovery, therapeutic application, and the development of new diagnostic tools."

The economic burden of this disease, which ranges from mild self-limiting diarrhea to devastating neurological complications, in the United States alone is estimated at more than USD 8 billion annually. Broiler chickens harbor these pathogens in their gastrointestinal tracts (GITs) without developing disease, and are primary reservoirs considered to be the principal source of human infection. Hence, efficacious vaccines for elimination of these pathogens from the GITs of broiler chickens will significantly reduce incidence of human Campylobacteriosis; however, despite an urgent need, currently there are no efficacious chicken Campylobacter vaccines commercially available. Thus far, progress toward development of efficacious Campylobacter chicken vaccines has been slow. This is because Campylobacter species that infect broiler chickens and have human disease causing potential are a very diverse group, which dictates that efficacious vaccines comprise multiple components, including proteins that are shared by the vast majority chicken Campylobacter strains/isolates with human disease causing potential (conserved proteins). Also, the lack of innovative discovery tools for identification of conserved pathogen proteins is another contributory factor, since such conserved proteins are ""hidden"" by the pathogen during natural infection to escape host defenses. PELS is one such innovative tool that has the ability to identify conserved pathogen proteins (antigens). This antigen discovery technology makes clever use of the response of a host infected with a pathogen to identify components (proteins) with potential for vaccines against the same pathogen. In this project, PELS will be applied in an innovative manner, and coupled with a suite of computer-based algorithms for identification of proteins that are shared by diverse Campylobacter chicken and human strains/isolates. It is expected that this study will result in a panel of conserved Campylobacter proteins, a subset of which is likely to have potential for development of broadly protective Campylobacter chicken vaccines. Future studies in broiler chickens will examine if these proteins can function as vaccines. Such vaccines are anticipated to reduce the public health burden, as well as significantly reduce health care costs currently expended toward management of human Campylobacteriosis in the United States."

They are spending significant dollars on energy bills and wasting as much as 25% of that energy. Buildings accounted for 81% ($294 billion) of total dollars spent on U.S. electricity in 2008 and consumed more than 50% of the natural gas. A community-based energy efficiency program that involves community leaders and residents in energy conservation and efficiency efforts can reduce waste and save money to improve the bottom lines for private citizens, companies, non-profits and local government. Operations and management best practices can save 5% to 20% on energy bills without investing significant capital. Depending on building size and use, this can represent savings of hundreds to hundreds-of-thousands of dollars annually for each building. The School for Energy Efficiency (SEE) program was developed by CLASS 5, Inc. and is distributed in Iowa by Krell Energy Efficiency, LLC (KEE). School districts enrolled in SEE for four or more years have reduced their energy use by an average of over 20% through behavioral and operational changes. KEE will do the research in Phase I to show feasibility that the set of strategies (the CLASS 5 Process) that have a successful track record for energy reduction in large school systems can be restructured and re-priced to be successful for buildings that make up rural communities. We will work with two rural pilot communities: Manning in southwest Iowa and Charles City in northeast Iowa. We will evaluate the CLASS 5 Process used in SEE within our pilot communities and show the feasibility of: 1) energy reduction within a highly heterogeneous set of community buildings; 2) implementing the CLASS 5 process as a community-wide, sustainable energy efficiency program; 3) partnering with energy providers in the communities; and 4) developing a financial and pricing model that will provide a positive ROI on dollars invested by the community. Within each community, a set of buildings will be selected from a variety of sectors. An energy survey and detailed analysis of the energy consumption of each building will be completed. The average energy usage and energy cost per square foot are required to ascertain feasibility of developing a cost-effective energy efficiency program for the communities. In order to gain a better understanding of factors and issues in each of the communities, the relationships among institutional areas, and the potential for purposeful and united action on the part of the community, we will conduct interviews and small group discussions with community members and decision makers. Insights from the energy surveys of buildings and the community interviews will direct the development of a pricing model. Our goal will be to provide an ROI that allows community stakeholders to purchase the energy efficiency program. We will also gain insight into how future implementation of the program would proceed and how it could build community cohesion and pride."
"HANSON, ROBERT",Innovative high-airflow smokehouse design with novel method of controlling airflow to cook faster&amp;to reduce temperature&amp;color variation,Department of Agriculture,,Phase I,SBIR,2012-00093,2012-00093,,,USDA-NIFA-SBIR-003497,2012,85,2012,"$100,000.00 ",828927942,N,N,N,1,,16548 BIRCH ST,,Stilwell,KS,66085-7843,Robert E Hanson ,Principal,(913) 709-7566,bob.hanson@hansontech.net,Robert E Hanson ,Principal,(913) 709-7566,bob.hanson@hansontech.net,Stub,,,,"Industrial smokehouses are large forced-air convection batch ovens used to cook and smoke meat products such as bacon, ham, bologna, whole turkeys, chicken breast, snack sticks, jerky, smoked sausage, hotdogs, sliced luncheon meats, and other smoked meats. These huge smokehouses are crucial to the operation of the American meat industry, yet in the past two decades, the design of these ovens has stagnated. Evolutionary improvements have included improved construction materials, computer controls, higher efficiency gas burner and electric motors, and lower cost variable-speed fan drives. Incredibly, however, the cooking performance of smokehouses is virtually the same today as it was 25 years ago. Even more remarkable, the market leading smokehouse manufacturers all use air-handling systems that are very similar in function, and therefore very similar in performance. As such, regardless of the age or brand of smokehouse, most smokehouses in the field today have pretty much the same capabilities and performance. So if a company buys a brand-new smokehouse and installs it next to a 25 year-old one, the owner of the new smokehouse will be surprised to find that although the new oven has a modern control system, increased corrosion resistant, and higher efficiency components, when it comes to its performance in cooking smoked meats, the beat-up old oven will cook just as fast as the new one. Along with the universally anemic cooking performance of modern smokehouse designs, these out-dated air-handling systems create significant color, yield, and temperature variation. Field data show that yields typically vary as much as 1.5% within a single load, and this yield variation costs the industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Product temperatures routinely vary as much as 8-16 degrees F within a batch, creating a food safety risk of under-cooked product. To make sure that the products in the coldest areas of a smokehouse are fully cooked, oven operators must over-cook the entire load, resulting in food safety risks, reduced throughputs, and lost yield that again cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year. True innovation in smokehouse air-handling performance has been stagnant for decades, but the opportunity we see is to design an innovative new air-handling system for smokehouses that would allow users to produce smoked meats safer, better, and faster at lower cost -- both to improve efficiency of this multi-billion dollar industry and to advance consumer food safety. Our approach is to design an advanced new air-handling system that could be installed as an improved design on new smokehouses or retrofitted onto old ones, thus moving the food safety and manufacturing efficiency of the meat industry forward for both new and existing ovens without requiring the massive capital investment that would be required for a full replacement of existing smokehouses. Preliminary field trials have shown that our new air-handling concept has the potential to reduce cooking times by 10-20% and cut temperature variation in half."

The term distillers grains (DGS) is intended to include these and similar coproducts. The expansion of the ethanol industry has led to the wide spread availability and economic pricing of DGS, resulting in significant amounts of DGS being commonly included in beef finishing rations. The fermentation of the starch in corn during the production of ethanol results in a three-fold increase in the concentration of phosphorus in the DGS versus its concentration in corn grain. Excess phosphorus is considered a pollutant in surface waters. DGS typically replaces corn and protein supplements in the ration, and by doing so increases the phosphorus content in the feedlot manure by as much as 120% (Trenkle, 2006) at reasonable inclusion rates (20-40%). Thus, the amount of phosphorus present at the farm and the risk of polluting surface water can be increased. Reducing the concentration of phosphorus in DGS would reduce the amount of excess phosphorus being fed to livestock, thereby decreasing the risk of surface water pollution. In the past, efforts to address the challenge of excess phosphorus at livestock farms have considered feed management, in so far as eliminating unneeded phosphorus supplements, but most efforts have focused on manure treatment. Manure treatment can be effective. For example, Kansas Environmental Management Associates, LLC (KEMA) developed a wastewater phosphorus reduction system named Phred for use at livestock farms. However, this requires capital investment in a treatment system by each individual farm with a phosphorus imbalance, and results in decentralized production of removed phosphorus The ethanol industry has become the largest user of corn in the nation, which makes it one of the largest producers of livestock feed in the nation. Addressing the phosphorus surplus at the ethanol plant, is much more efficient than trying to address the problem at each feedlot?s location. Research from Iowa State University (Meyer, 2006) indicated that the amount of phosphorus excreted is directly related to the dietary phosphorus intake. So if the dietary phosphorus intake can be decreased by decreasing the phosphorus concentration in DGS, the excreted phosphorus should also be decreased. Based on available literature it is estimated that a reduction of phosphorus in the thin stillage by 50, 70, or 90 percent could reduce the phosphorus concentration in the final livestock feed (in this case ?wet distillers grain plus solubles?) by 31, 43, and 55% respectively. So, there is an excellent opportunity to significantly decrease surplus phosphorus being fed in feedlot rations. The Phred system developed by KEMA removes soluble phosphorus from livestock wastewater by converting it to an insoluble compound called struvite, or magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate. Phred is a very simple system, utilizing a fluidized bed reactor to produce 1 ? 3mm diameter struvite granules."

Unfortunately, harvest rates of wild fish have decreased by ~0.7 mmt per year over the past 20 years, and the FAO recently reported that 53% of the world&#039;s wild fish stocks are now fully exploited and 32% are over exploited. As a consequence of greater fish demand and the increasing trend of over exploited and depleted stocks, aquaculture production has increased by 9% annually over the last decade. Similar trends of greater demand for and lower wild harvest of fish meal protein have led to a rapid escalation in price of this product. In 2005, 2.7 mmt of fish meal was used in aquaculture feeds, while an estimated 6.7 mmt will be required by 2012. This rate of growth is unsustainable and is reflected in current fish meal prices which are already hampering the economic production of fish and shellfish products for human consumption. Lower cost, more sustainable plant-derived sources of protein have been increasing tested to partially replace fish meal in aquaculture diets. Soybean meal (SBM) has been used to replace up to 20% of total protein in diets for several species, while soy protein concentrate (SPC) has been tested successfully at higher total protein replacement levels. These soybean products provide high protein and relative good amino acid profiles, but are still deficient in some critical amino acids required by carnivorous fishes. SPC can be used at higher levels than SBM, primarily because the solvent extraction process and heat treatment used to produce SPC removes or inactivates undesirable factors. The primary limitations of the current solvent extraction process are its cost, the lack of use for the undesirable components removed in the process, and quality issues that frequently limit inclusion to 50% of total protein in the diet. Corn DDGS has been evaluated in diets at fish meal replacement levels of up to 20%. DDGS has lower protein (28-32%) and more fiber than soy products, but is typically priced at ~50% the value of defatted SBM. Some ethanol plants have incorporated a dry fractionation process to remove part of the fiber and oil prior to the conversion process, resulting in a dry-frac DDGS of up to 42% protein. While this product has been used to replace 20-40% of fish meal in aquaculture feeds, there is considerable market opportunity for an even higher protein DDGS. Prairie AquaTech proposes to convert the fibers and other carbohydrates in DDGS into additional protein using microbial conversion. An constituent byproduct will also facilitate extruded feed pellet formation, may provide an immunostimulant activity to activate innate defense mechanisms that protect fish, and increase corn protein digestibility and absorption during metabolism, providing higher feed efficiency and yields. We anticipate this microbial treatment process will provide a valuable, sustainable aquaculture feed that is less expensive on a protein basis than SBM, SPC, and fish meal."

This work will develop an engineered cyanobacterium capable of converting CO2 into farnesene (C15H24), a long-chain hydrocarbon with an energy density of 47 MJ/Kg, heat of vaporization of 0.24 MJ/Kg, and octane of 89.7. The cells would excrete farnesene into the recirculating culture fluid, where it would be recovered by low-cost phase separation for use as an energy-dense, infrastructure compatible biofuel. We have already established the validity of this ""cyanofactory"" platform by engineering Anabaena to produce the ten-carbon alcohol linalool. Farnesene has a much higher energy density and thus would be a more desirable 3rd generation biofuel."

The proposed test is intended to enable dentists to differentiate between cavitated and non-cavitated tooth decay in the areas where teeth are in contact (interproximal surfaces). In these areas, dentists cannot visually inspect for caries, and currently bitewing X- rays (BWs) only correctly detect the presence of enamel decay 15-25% of the time. This low sensitivity can lead to late treatment resulting in unnecessarily large fillings crowns, pain, root canals, and possible later loss of teeth. The proposed method will use a liquid radiographic contrast agent, which will be applied in the interproximal regions immediately before dentists perform routine BW X-rays. A tooth with a cavity (hole) will appear opaque on the radiograph whereas a healthy or non-cavitated decay patch will not. No increase in radiation, purchase of extra equipment or extensive training are required. It is anticipated the final product will be inexpensive to use. The lack of extra radiation, capital expenditure or major  training should reduce the barriers for dentists to adopt the test which is anticipated to increase  the overall diagnostic accuracy of BWs from about 58% to 90%. Hypothesis: Use of radiographic contrast will increase detection of early interproximal cavitated decay from a sensitivity of 15-25% to 90% and specificity will remain at about 90%. Method: 41 subjects between 14-40 years who require a posterior tooth extraction will be recruited. From pre- existing screening BWs potential subjects will be identified with at least one interproximal radiolucency in the tooth for extraction or on the adjacent teeth surfaces. Tooth surfaces will be cleaned with air-water spray and floss. Two BWs will be exposed (control). Teeth will be dried with air. Contrast liquid will be applied in the interproximal spaces and excess removed. Two more BWs will be exposed (test). The subject will have the diseased tooth removed. The interproximal surfaces of the adjacent teeth and extractedtooth will be examined directly by visual inspection and gently with a sharp probe. Any cavities detected will be photographed and the size of the opening recorded. Three dentists will identify cavities from the blinded control and test BWs in a randomized order. 10% will be reread. The accuracy of non-contrast to contrast BWs will be compared to direct inspection.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will test the use of radiographic contrast with existing X-ray examinations to increase the accuracy for detecting early decay cavities (holes) between teeth in the interproximal areas. Existing methods (direct visual inspection, use of sharp explorers, and conventional bitewing radiographs) have a combined accuracy of only 58% - the proposed methodis anticipated to increase accuracy to 90%. This will assist detection and monitoring of decay, likely reducing the late caries diagnosis that can cause large fillings, crowns, root canals and/or tooth loss, and also reducing unnecessary filling by betterenabling dentists to track the progression of decay and detect if it has stopped."

PDAC diagnosis is difficult, usually occurring in the late stages of disease. Patients with these advanced tumors typically respondpoorly to therapy. Post diagnosis, median survival is 6 months and the five-year survival rate is lt 4%. Five-year survival is lt 1% for those with advanced cancer. Progression to advanced disease occurs with few, if any, symptoms but studies have shown that there is a long period of time during which early detection may be possible. There appears to be a timeline for detection of specific biomarkers during the disease&#039;s development: (1) in Stage 1a, mutations in K-RAS occur early when there are minimal visible cytological, morphological or symptomatic changes; (2) in Stages1b and 2, additional genetic mutations occur that lead to Her-2 overexpression and p16 inactivation; (3) in Stage 3, mutations occur in the TP53, DPC4, and BRCA2 genes. The lack of symptoms in the early stages means that patients go undetected until the later stages when treatments may not be as effective. It is not feasible to routinely test pancreatic tissues for markers of early disease and it has been difficult to identify disease markers in plasma, serum and/or urine that might enable early disease detection. The discovery of the accumulated mutations in many human pancreatic tumors, specifically in K-RAS and TP53, has suggested that pancreatic cancer animal models are useful for the study of disease development. These mouse models will be used to test the application of Ice COLD-PCR to the high sensitive detection of K- RAS and Trp53 mutations in urine and blood. Further, this model system will allow the study of pancreatitis- relatedprogression to pancreatic cancer stage 1 in a mutant K-RAS background. Pancreatitis will be induced in these mice models which will enable a time-line investigation of early detection of K-RAS and Trp53 mutations in murine samples. The method will be further validated in several tissues from well-characterized human pancreatic autopsy samples, including pancreas, blood and urine. If promising results are obtained from these Phase I studies, a Phase II STTR application will include more comprehensive studiesof Ice COLD-PCR detection of DNA mutations associated with early and late stage pancreatic cancer in humans. This could ultimately lead to a simple, highly sensitive diagnostic assay for the early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pancreatic cancer is difficult to diagnose at an early stage. In the disease&#039;s late stage response to therapy is poor with an average survival of 6 months after diagnosis and a five-year survival rate of less than 4%.

The proposed innovation is a microbially-based process to economically produce HQSPC by converting soybean carbohydrates into protein, yielding the exopolysaccharide for pellet binding and the immunoprophylactic for enhanced health. Our preliminary data indicates that the proposed microbe will metabolize individual carbohydrates in soybeans. To demonstrate technical and commercial feasibility, extrusion and enzymatic saccharification will be used to solubilize carbohydrates in soybean white flake, followed by incubation with the gum-producing microbe and recovery of solids for use in yellow perch feeding trials. The broader commercial impacts of this research include the development of a plant-based protein source to replace fishmeal in aquaculture production systems. Increased demand for fish protein and reduced wild-captured fish has facilitated rapid growth of the aquaculture industry. This growth has dramatically increased the demand for fish meal, the primary component in aquaculture feeds, causing overexploitation of this resource and rapidly escalating prices up to $1,800/ton. There is a considerable market opportunity for a high quality, economical plant derived protein concentrate to completely replace fish meal in aquaculture feeds, thus providing broad impact. Successful development and testing of HQSPC that provides desirable growth rates and conversion efficiencies will be of commercial interest to international aquaculture feed manufacturers, as well as commercial aquaculture production facilities."

The performance of nitride-based devices, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, and transistors, is limited by epitaxial growth on foreign substrates. LEDs with aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) active regions emitting in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum are limited to an efficiency of ~1%, but are especially suited to growth on AlN due to the lattice match. Thus, there is an opportunity to enhance the performance of these devices by using closely-matched AlN substrates with low defect density. The proposed approach to grow bulk AlN utilizes a novel vapor phase deposition method which uses low cost consumables, is scalable to high product rates, and is capable of high quality. The research objectives are to demonstrate AlN crystals of excellent crystal quality with low dislocation density (10000/square cm), grown at a high growth rate of 1 mm/hr. The successful completion of these objectives will lay the groundwork for high-volume and low-cost production of high quality AlN substrates. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a result of a dramatic increase in the availability of low-cost AlN substrates for use in optoelectronics and energy conversion devices. The development of commercially viable AlN substrates will enable revolutionary performance enhancements for many devices, specifically including UV LEDs, in terms of output power, energy efficiency, and lifetime. High efficiency UV LEDs will have a broad range of applications including replacement of toxic mercury vapor lamps used for UV purification, UV curing, and chemical sensors, and UV LEDs will enable new applications which require compact and robust UV emitters. One of the most important benefits to society is the ability to provide an effective, low cost, and chemical free method to disinfect water for human consumption. Finally, as a supplier of a high-value enabling semiconductor material, we intend to market to smaller niche semiconductor manufacturing companies in the U.S. as early adopters of AlN substrates, thus strengthening the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing industry."

The current ASL monitor uses a conventional, thermal light source, which is inherently low-brightness and will significantly reduce the instrument?s throughput and SNR when coupled to a limited-aperture fiber. The small emitting area of the SLD, however, is perfectly suited to fiber coupling, and presents a significant advantage in throughput, allowing for accurate measurements in highly turbid solutions. During this effort, SLD devices will be fabricated and coupled to a fiber-optic test assembly. Their analytical performance will be evaluated during live fermentation processes. For a commercial in situ probe that utilizes an SLD to be feasible, it must be capable of obtaining high-quality spectra with an SNR equivalent to or better than the present ASL monitor. The broader/commercial impacts of this research will both improve the performance of the current ASL bioreactor monitor and enable in situ sampling, which is highly desirable by potential users of this technology. The availability of continuous on-line measurements of key analytes provided by the ASL monitor during protein expression with Pichia pastoris and E. coli supplies a means for active feedback control, aiding in optimization of production yields and helping maintain quality control.

The difficulties inherent in radiofluorination chemistry have severely limited the scope of radiotracers available for clinical use. This NSF SBIR Phase 1 project addresses this critical problem using the company?s proprietary single-step fluorination technology. This technology advances the current state-of-the-art with simple, fast, and highly efficient radiofluorination, permitting an entire new class of drugs to be labeled with no-carrier-added [18F]fluoride for the first time. The project will focus on the synthesis of clinically relevant radiotracers for pediatric cancer and Parkinson?s disease. Technical studies to be performed using this support include optimization of this new radiofluorination manufacturing methodology across multiple radiosynthesis platforms. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide technology to expand the scope of PET as a platform for determining the identification and staging of diseases, and assessing the efficacy of treatment regimens. PET is an underutilized diagnostic imaging technique that is stymied by the lack of highly efficient, broadly applicable radiofluorination methods. The radiotracer manufacturing technology developed here is extremely general and applicable to the preparation of new imaging agents for PET. The availability of this general labeling technique can also speed development of new drugs by providing in vivo biomarkers of new therapeutic agents which can be used to determine optimal dosing of new drugs and variability of biodistribution in target populations. The commercial potential of PET imaging is significant; the worldwide market for PET is expected to grow to $15 billion by 2015.

In Phase II, a 250W stack module will be developed employing the new materials and optimal cell design to demonstrate the cost reduction and performance gain as opposed to stacks using state-of-the-art materials.
A number of modules can be combined in parallel to support large power demands. An analysis on a 2.5kW-4hour energy storage system consisting of ten proposed modules shows that it meets the ARPA-E’s primary targets: 1.2m3 footprint, at least 80% round trip efficiency, lifetime more than 1250 cycles and under $1000 per unit. It can be charged by solar power systems or electric grids to store off-peak electricity at customer’s location. The success of this project will be truly transformational for large-scale H2/Br2 electrochemical energy storage systems to have a greater impact on economic and energy security of the United States."""

While much is known regarding the characterization of this decline, remarkably little of the physiology or genetic underpinnings are understood. Age-related sleep changes in rodents (mice + rats) are remarkably similar to those seen in human populations and as such these animal models are frequently used to study the aging process. However, the current state-of-the-art technology necessary for measuring sleep in rodents requires surgical implantation of EEG and electromyograph (EMG) probes. Drawbacks to this process include the need for an invasive and time-consuming animal surgery paired with a prolonged recovery period. The time component is extremely slow as the animal must recover from surgery and acclimate to the recording chamber and tether before normal sleep can be evaluated. Additionally, biofouling of the implanted screws and decay of the chronic implant alters signal quality over time and restricts long-term recordings to only a few continuous months. Labor expenses include the need to hire an expert technician to run the equipment, undertake surgery and evaluate sleep data. To overcome these difficulties we plan to use accelerated video hardware, 3-D video monitoring and a deep red grid (invisible to the rodent) to measure sleep state. In Phase I of this application, Pinnacle Technology Inc and the University of Pennsylvania Center for Sleep and Respiratory Neurobiology will create a workingprototype (software, electronics, and hardware) for non-invasive detection of sleep state in rodents. Specifically, this system aims to be the first commercial device designed to record and automatically analyze wake, NREM and REM sleep in rodents using non-surgical, non-invasive techniques. A unique benefit to this design is that it will be capable of continuously recording sleep-wake architecture from the same animal across the lifespan. The system, once validated, can easily be used as a large-scale screening tool to rapidly screen hundreds of animals. Commercial applications of such a device are already being sought by major pharmaceutical companies as they explore new potential gene products for targeted therapy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that at least 40 million Americans suffer each year from chronic, long-term sleep disorders while an additional 20 million experience occasional sleeping problems. As people age, sleeping disorder are more prevalent; more than 50 percent of peopleolder than 64 have a sleep disorder. Economically, poor sleep accounts for an estimated  16 billion in medical costs each year and the indirect costs of lost productivity and other factors are known to be much higher."

Besides the personal toll on the patients and their caregivers (who often are family members), the cost of caring for those with dementia is anticipated to grow from the 2011 estimate of  187 billion to  1.1 trillion by the year 2050. Currently the most widely acceptedautomated method for measurement of the hippocampus in Alzheimer&#039;s disease is FreeSurfer. At Brain Image Analysis, LLC we have processed the MRI data from the ADNI 1 dataset (gt3500 scans) using our automated pipeline, BRAINS AutoWorkup. In our analysis have found that, in comparisons with both the standard FreeSurfer and the longitudinal stream in FreeSurfer, our methods detect a higher annual atrophy rate with a lower relative standard deviation. This leads to a substantial reduction in the estimates of subjects needed per arm of a clinical trial from 131 or 204 using FreeSurfer (longitudinal and cross-sectional workflows) to 56 using BRAINS ANN methods. This application describes how we intend to implement and test a longitudinal ANN method and test our current hippocampal segmentations against those being prepared by a collaboration of Alzheimer&#039;s disease researchers and hippocampus experts. This will provide Brain Image Analysis, LLC with the information it needs to show our methods of subcortical segmentation are the most feasible in the field for commercial image processing in the study of Alzheimer&#039;s disease and its treatment. Phase II of this project will encompass implementation of these methods into the newest version of BRAINS and the additional program infrastructure to make our methods available on a larger commercial scale, as well as implementation on a large dataset to explore clinical correlates.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Alzheimer&#039;s disease afflicts an estimated 5.1 million people in the United States, and as life expectancies increase it is anticipated that this number will continue to rise (Hebert et al., 2003). Besides the personal toll on the patients and their caregivers (who often are family members), the cost of caring for those with dementia is anticipated to grow from the 2011 estimate of  187 billion to  1.1 trillion by the year 2050 (Institute of Medicine, 2008). The Alzheimer&#039;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative is an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer&#039;s disease. One of the main focuses of work related to the ADNI dataset is to enhance clinical trials through providing sensitive biomarkers, such as hippocampus measures of atrophy rates, with which disease modifying effects may be monitored in clinical trials. At Brain Image Analysis, LLC we have used our current methods to analyze the ADNI MRI dataset and have found our methods to be very sensitive to hippocampal atrophy, requiring less than 1/2 the number of subjects compared to FreeSurfer to detect a 25 percent reduction in atrophy rates in a clinical trial. In this applicatin we propose to further develop and strengthen our methods as commercially available service in monitoring disease course and as biomarkers in clinical trials of agents designed to alter the course of the disease. This Phase I SBIR application proposes the following aims to more completely assess our current methods, expand them into a longitudinal pipeline, and evaluate them against a   consensus   hippocampal definition being developed in the Alzheimer&#039;s research community. AIM 1 - Implement a longitudinal artificial neural network hippocampal segmentation in BRAINS and assess its accuracy and sensitivity in following hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer&#039;s disease, in comparison that the standard ANN used to process the preliminary data. AIM2 - Compare the results ofour current hippocampal segmentation with the   consensus   methods being developed by Giovanni Frisoni and Clifford Jack.

This year, another 1.5 million will be diagnosed with one of nearly 200 different cancer types. Despite an ever---growing understanding of the environmental risk factors, genetic contributions, and tumorigenic mechanisms, the diagnoses and treatments for this disease remain inadequate. Much of what is known about cancer has come from studies of cells in culture and small animal models. While these model systems have been extremely informative, they also possess limitations and present challenges to translating promising therapies to the clinic. The lack of a large animal model that accurately replicates human cancer has been amajor barrier to the development of effective diagnostic tools, interventions, and therapies for this deadly disease. Pigs share many similarities with humans in anatomy, physiology, genetics, and importantly, size. While naturally occurring tumors are rarely seen due to standard pork production practices, spontaneous and induced cancers have been studied in pigs and are highly representative of what is seen in humans. However, the extended timeframe required for inducing cancer in pigs and the accompanyingphenotypic variability limit their usefulness. Our objective is to create a genetically engineered pig in which tumorigenesis can be conditionally induced in any tissue. We intend to accomplish this by mutating two of the most commonly affected genes in human cancer, KRAS and TP53 (encoding p53). KRAS is in oncogene encoding a small GTPase that couples receptor activation and downstream effectors to control cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Activating mutations in KRAS are common in many human tumors. Known as the   guardian of the genome  , p53 is a transcription factor that regulates critical cell functions including cell---cycle arrest and apoptosis. The loss of proper p53 function predisposes cells to unregulated growth, tumor formation,and metastasis. Mouse models expressing conditional mutations in KRAS and TP53 have yielded excellent models representative of human cancers of the lung, pancreas, colon, and other tissues. We hypothesize that mutations in porcine KRAS and TP53 will produce similar results in pigs. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this project is to develop and commercialize KRAS/TP53--mutated pigs to serve as a platform for models of human cancer. We intend to accomplish this by combining gene targeting and somatic cell nuclear transfer. This proposal specifically outlines the development of porcine fibroblasts with mutated KRAS and TP53 alleles. A gene targeting vector will be developed and used to disrupt the endogenous porcine KRAS via homologous recombination in both TP53---targeted and wild---type cells. Subsequent work will use these cells as nuclear donors for somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce KRAS/TP53---mutated pigs. These models will provide academic and industry researchers with an opportunity to better understand cancer and its pathogenesis and to develop and test new diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventative strategies."

Nicotine is singularly responsible for the dependence-forming properties of tobacco smoking and, once introduced to the body, rapidly affects the brain within 15 seconds. Breaking nicotine addiction is challenging and relapse rates remain high. The extremely rapid timescale of nicotine action renders existing techniques for studying nicotine accumulation in the brain (e.g., microdialysis,PET, radioimmunoassay) ill-suited for long-term addiction studies in freely moving animals. Biosensors are a proven technology for monitoring real-time changes in CNS neurochemical concentrations. The most critical component of a biosensor is the enzyme used as the biorecognition element, and no aspect of a biosensor&#039;s final design is as vital as a properly folded enzyme with sufficient activity and stability profiles. To date, no nicotine-specific enzyme has been reported. A primary goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to begin the transformation of an existing oxidase enzyme&#039;s kcat, stability at 37oC, Km, and Tm into an enzyme capable of the specific detection of nicotine - a process that will be completed during Phase II. We will combine structure-guided design with directed protein evolution (including a suitable selection process) to hone and optimize a new nicotine oxidase enzyme suitable as the foundation of a nicotine biosensor. The resulting nicotine biosensor promises to impact nicotine addictionstudies by allowing real-time recordings of CNS nicotine concentrations in freely moving animals for up to one week. Furthermore, the nicotine biosensor could be used in conjunction with other biosensors, which will allow for the simultaneous monitoring ofchanges in nicotine concentration in tandem with other important CNS analytes (i.e., glucose, glutamate, lactate) or addictive compounds (i.e., ethanol). This approach promises to reveal new insights into nicotine distribution, dynamics and flux. Furthermore, a nicotine biosensor should find use as a screening tool for the development of new pharmacologic agents designed to assist in smoking cessation and inhibit relapse. The completion of both Phase I and Phase II components will provide two important innovations to the scientific community: 1) A nicotine biosensor suitable for long-term (i.e., up to one week) addiction studies that provides second-by-second changes of nicotine concentration in the CNS. 2) A refined approach for the development of new biosensors that target analytes important for addiction and for which no oxidase enzyme currently exists (i.e., cocaine and caffeine).          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that 50% of regular smokers die due to smoking-related complications. In addition, nicotine addiction associated with cigarette smoking takes a tremendous economic toll, costing the United States nearly  200 billion annually, including  97 billion in lost productivity and  96 billion in health care expenditures. This projec allows for a better understanding of nicotine addiction, which could advance smoking cessation research and potentially prevent 450,000 smoking-related deaths per year in the United States."

Our proposed strategy uses Precision Particle Fabrication (PPF) to create betamethasone-loaded microspheres for transtympanic injection, round window membrane (RWM) localization, and sustained-release to the inner ear. The central advantage of our approach is that PPF technology allows for precise control of particle size, shape, material,and release rates. Our long-term goal is for transtympanic delivery of PPF-enabled betamethasone-loaded microspheres to be the standard-of-care for people who suffer from SSNHL. We hypothesize that microspheres can be retained on the RWM for two weeks andthat betamethasone release can be maintained within 25% of a therapeutic dose (~55 ng/day). We expect that this novel approach will enable sustained levels of therapeutic concentrations of betamethasone to the inner ear that will dramatically improve the safety and efficacy of SSNHL treatments over currently available options. Our research team will first develop and characterize the relationship between the microsphere size and betamethasone release profiles to establish the feasibility of achieving long-term, controlled release to the inner ear (Aim 1). We will then determine the optimal microsphere immobilization strategy to enable RWM localization for a minimum of 14 days with minimal toxicity (Aim 2). The result will be microspheres that sustain a precise betamethasone dose and adhere to the RWM for sufficient time. After establishing the feasibility of this approach, we will, in Phase II, demonstrate our ability to precisely control the pharmacokinetic profile of inner ear betamethasone concentrations in small (mouse) and large (sheep) animal models. This PPF- enabled drug-delivery strategy addresses issues of dosage accuracy and long-term release. In addition, PPF- based encapsulation is highly adaptable and can serve as a transtympanic delivery platform for multiple drug classes. This unique strategy has significant potential to become the standard-of-care for treatment of SSNHL.

A novel  technology that masks bitter drug flavors while providing flexibility in dose design and format would enable formulation of existing adult pharmaceutical products into medications specially designed for pediatric patients. Our proposed strategy uses Precision Particle Fabrication (PPF) to develop pediatric drug-loaded microparticles that mask bitter flavors and allow for flexible dosing and formats. The central advantage of PPF technology lies in its precise control of particle size, shape, material, and release rates. Our long-term goal is to adapt this flexible, user-friendly, inexpensive technology to create a platform for microencapsulating unpalatable pediatric active pharmaceutical ingredients (API&#039;s). We hypothesize that theuniform, precisely engineered microparticles produced by PPF will create effectively taste- masked formulations for pediatric drugs while also allowing for the swift and controlled release of the active agents under digestive conditions. We further hypothesize that this robust microparticle strategy will allow for accurate, flexible dosing and adaptation to multiple drug delivery formats.  Our research team will develop and characterize model bitter API-containing microparticles with precisely controlled physicochemical features that are designed to meet palatability standards (Aim 1). We will then optimize the release characteristics and taste-masking performance of these model microparticles (Aim 2). The result will be model drug-loaded microparticles thatmeet palatability standards based on particle size, homogeneity, and drug surface concentration and that can be tailored for desired release profiles under digestive conditions. After establishing the feasibility of precisely engineering these microparticles, Phase II will focus on the clinical evaluation of organoleptic properties of taste and mouth feel as well as demonstration of dosing accuracy, titration, and format flexibility. This PPF-based encapsulation strategy addresses issues of palatability, dosage accuracy, and format flexibility in pediatric drugs, while improving upon existing encapsulation techniques that are costly and time-consuming and produce poorly controlled, heterogeneous batches of microparticles. In adition, this PF technology is highly adaptable to multiple drugs and matrix/coating materials as well as large-scale production. The result will be an inexpensive, highly flexible pediatric platform for creating palatable, age-appropriate, and accurate dosage forms, leading to safer pediatric formulations and improved patient compliance.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Inadequate pediatric pharmaceutical formulations impair effective treatment of diseases in children due to poor compliance, ad hoc formulations, and dangerous medicationerrors. At the foundation of the problem are palatability, accurate dosing, and age-appropriate dosage format challenges. Development of a user-friendly, inexpensive development platform for pediatric reformulation of existing adult drug products to administer taste-masked active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with controlled release rates is needed. Using model bitter APIs, this project aims to test the feasibility of Precision Particle Fabricatio technology to produce palatable, age-appropriate, and accurate doses as a means to safer pediatric medications and better compliance."

The microbiosensors produced will enable in vivo monitoring of a wide range of non-electroactive, neurologically relevant analytes, including, but not limited to, glucose, glutamate, lactate, choline, histamine, D-serine, and ethanol. The design can be extended to multiple conjoined capillaries to provide an array of biosensors for the simultaneous monitoring of multiple analytes, with high temporal and spatial resolution, which causes minimal damage to the surrounding tissue. The specific aim for Phase I is to demonstrate feasibility by prototyping and characterizing a tissue implantable enzyme functionalized nanoparticle microbiosensor that is suitable for in vivo brain measurements and extensible to multianalyte microbiosensor arrays. The proposed microbiosensor will allow researchers to target smaller subregions of the brain that would be damaged by currently available probes. This, in turn, will lead to a better understanding of function and assist in quantifying drug response. The proposed microbiosensor design can also beadapted to the simultaneous monitoring of multiple analytes within a single region of space. Turn-key tools that allow an enhanced level of specificity and granularity will be widely useful in research on the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment ofneurological disorders, and this will lead to new discoveries. Pinnacle will lead this application and work in conjunction with an interdisciplinary consortium of three leading scientists at the University of Kansas. Professor Judy Wu possesses extensiveexperience in materials science and nanofabrication techniques, Professor Mark Richter is skilled in protein engineering, and Professor George Wilson brings over 30 years of experience in biosensor development to the project. The facilities and equipment available at Pinnacle, and the various University of Kansas laboratories, will provide the resources required to successfully complete this project. Innovative aspects of this application include the use of active enzyme functionalized nanoparticles as thesensing element, and the controlled electrophoretic deposition of these nanoparticles. Also novel is a design that maximizes oxygen reuse and hydrogen peroxide detection efficiency. This will lead to linear microbiosensors with high sensitivity for the analyte being monitored. Extensive preliminary results are presented in the application. These results are the foundation for this Phase I effort.  Overall, worldwide biosensor sales in FY2009 were  6.9 billion with 31 percent of the sales due to human glucose sensors. Pinnacle is an established manufacturer of biosensors and is well positioned to introduce this new class of biosensors to a broad pre-clinical market.

Study of hemodynamics is very important in physiology courses for anyone studying blood flows. Teaching the principles of hemodynamics has not significantly changed over the last forty years. We propose to develop an affordable system that utilizes an inexpensive version of a highly visual technology - Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) ? to be used in teaching hemodynamic principles experimentally. Using PIV with interchangeable blood vessel models can visually illustrate fundamental laws of hemodynamics. However, research level PIV systems utilize high-power lasers and usually cost over $100K. The high cost and safety considerations prohibit adaptation of PIV systems in the education system. We will not only develop a method to create interchangeable blood vessel models from silicone and an affordable PIV system but also create learning materials and novel teaching strategies by developing software as a virtual teaching assistant for the education process, where the students can develop enhanced understanding of hemodynamics by interactive experiments. This will be an important technological leap. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to advance the teaching of hemodynamics. In addition the system has the potential to be used to validate computer simulations, and assess the hydrodynamic performance of cardiovascular devices. The number of animals used for teaching in in-vivo experiments may also be reduced. The system will provide faculty the latest technology as a teaching tool at an affordable price, allowing them to acquire new knowledge and skills and to revise their curricula and teaching practices. The low cost of the system will allow schools with limited budgets to use the state of the art technology to teach hemodynamics to their students. Due to its simplicity of operation, low cost and being highly visual, this technology can be used at museums, science centers and similar institutions to develop exhibits in science and engineering. Apart from teaching, successful implementation of this technology in an affordable and easy to use form can in the future enable investigators to visualize flow in patient-specific accurate blood vessel models made quickly using rapid prototyping systems. Our commercial partner, LaVision, is excited about this as they see a growing demand, and worldwide market potential is $250MM."

Left unchecked, these errant slurry particles/ agglomerates can ""kill"" (deeply scratch) a semiconductor wafer as it undergoes chemical mechanical planarizing or polishing. CMP has become the method of choice for restoring the surface trueness of wafers at all stages of IC manufacture. This acoustic slurry monitor makes use of a novel technology?Acoustic Coaxing Induced Microcavitation (ACIM), a means of constructively controlling acoustic microcavitation. It does so by facilitating controlled bubble nucleation preferentially on the large particle, in the midst of dense nano-fine slurry. This research is thus aimed at investigating a new principle of bubble nucleation. In operation the slurry monitor will inspect a 100ml of the slurry charge at final dispense point just before the slurry is fed to the polishing pad. It will complete the detection for large particles in fully dense CMP slurry in one minute. This slurry monitor can be mounted on the existing CMP tools. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project are to enable improved yields in semiconductor manufacturing by making CMP processing scratch free. No method currently exists that can implement a CMP-safe slurry at the point of use. An advanced device wafer scratched at the final stages of manufacture is a direct loss of $250k or more. Use of the Acoustic Slurry Monitor protects wafers and more than returns the $100k investment with the very first wafer it saves. The Slurry Monitor is a yield protecting tool reliably improving CMP performance. Ultimately, the principle of constructively controlled microcavitation, ACIM particle detection, relies on controlling the very fundamental process of phase change, the control of nucleation?the ability to convert a liquid into a gas in the vicinity of a solid phase. The study of this acoustically mediated nucleation control could form an active field/area of research and education. ACIM will be widely applicable in a variety of liquid-chemical processing, e.g. control of boiling processes in chemical and nuclear reactors, sonochemical synthesis, and bio-technology. This small business is a minority and woman-owned company that relies on diversity?ethnic, gender and age?for robust performance that is dedicated to training young researchers."

The consequent loss of functional dystrophin results in the progressive degeneration of skeletal and cardiac muscle. Despite significant progress in our understanding of this disease and advances in the development of new therapeutic approaches, DMD remains a fatal disease. Much of what is known about DMD has come from studying dystrophin-deficient animals, particularly murine and canine models. While useful for mechanistic studies, dystrophic mice fail to develop the muscle weakness phenotype that is typical of DMD in patients. The canine models are more representative of human DMD, but are difficult to study due to extreme phenotypic variability. The canine models also suffer from a limited choice of mutations, significant expense, and social acceptance concerns. Therapeutic strategies that have shown promise in these models have failed to be translated to the clinic. An animal model that more accurately and consistently replicates the clinical manifestations of human DMD is sorely needed. Our objective is to create an improved model of DMD in thepig. We believe a porcine model offers several advantages over the existing models. Gene targeting is now available in pigs and would provide an opportunity to engineer patient-relevant mutations. Porcine cloning technology would allow the production of genetically identical dystrophic pigs and could yield reduced variability in phenotype severity. Also, pigs are less expensive to produce and easier to house than dogs and don&#039;t face the same ethical concerns as companion animals. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop and commercialize DMD-targeted pigs as a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We intend to accomplish this by combining gene targeting and somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a porcine model harboring a common human DMD mutation.This proposal specifically outlines the development of porcine fibroblasts with a mutated DMD gene. Gene targeting vectors will be constructed to delete a portion of the endogenous porcine DMD gene in a region frequently mutated in patients. Porcine fetalfibroblasts will be infected with a virus carrying the DMD targeting vectors. Our plans for generating properly targeted cells are designed to maximize the frequency of homologous recombination, minimize random integration, and minimize the number of cellpassages before targeted cells are harvested. Subsequent work will use these cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce DMD-targeted pigs, followed by phenotypic characterization and validation. This animal model will provide the academic and commercial research communities an opportunity to better understand DMD and to develop and test new therapeutic strategies        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative This proposal specifically outlines the development of porcine fibroblasts with mutated DMD alleles as a first step towards a new model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Subsequent work will use these cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce dystrophic pigs that will then be characterized and validated as an appropriate model. This project is relevant to the NIH&#039;s mission because it will provide a resource to stimulate discovery, therapeutic application, and the development of new diagnostic tools."

The proposed research is designed to develop a novel class of opioid analgesicsthat produce less tolerance and may potentially reduce opiate-associated side effects. Opioid ligands activate G protein coupled receptors (GPCR) to mediate diverse physiological functions. The regulation of these receptors can ultimately determine the extent of opioid receptor ligand efficacy. Genetically modified mice that lack molecular components of GPCR regulation display greatly attenuated opioid analgesic tolerance. Therefore, opioid agonists conferring non-conventional receptor conformations could yield novel analgesics with reduced tolerance liabilities. Recently, Herkinorin, a salvinorin A derivative, was found to be a potent and selective mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonist in vitro and in vivo. The diterpene chemical structure represents a novel lead for the design of opiate agonists with distinct pharmacological properties. This selective mu opioid receptor agonist activates the receptor, induces antinociception in rats, yet does not induce ssarrestin2 recruitment nor induce internalization of the receptor under any condition tested - distinguishing it from all known MOR agonists. The ultimate goal of this Proposal is to develop novel analgesics with reduced analgesic tolerance and side effects. We will achieve this goal using the following SpecificAims: 1): synthesize opioid ligands derived from Herkinorin to remove esterase-degradation sites, improve solubility, and preserve or improve MOR selectivity; and 2) determine pharmacological properties of Herkinorin analogs by testing activity of G protein signaling efficacy and potency and looking for absence of ssarrestin recruitment to MOR for analogues that efficaciously and potently activate MOR-mediated G protein coupling. Mencuro Therapeutic Inc. was co-founded by the inventors of these compounds, to commercialize this technology by developing potent mu opioid receptor agonists without the usual opioid side-effects. SARmont, LLC, is a drug discovery and design company, led by Dr. John Talley, the lead inventor of Celebrex(R) and 7 other NCEs that have made it to the marketplace. Mencuro will contract SARmont to provide medicinal chemistry services, specifically in compound synthesis, molecular design, and structure- activity relationship analysis. Mencuro will conduct all the in vitro testing. Successin this Proposal will lead to the submission of a Phase II grant focused on further medicinal chemistry optimization for potency and selectivity, in vivo validation using established mammalian models for pain treatment, and pre-clinical safety studies required for IND submission.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic and persistent, severe pain results from many disorders and diseases and affects over 80 million adults annually. Opioid analgesics block pain perception by targeting the mu opioid receptor (MOR); however, this receptor also mediates unwanted opioid side-effects such as tolerance, dependence, constipation and overdose. The goal of this Proposal is to create MOR agonists that provide pain relief without unwanted side-effects."

Current treatments for A-T are directed primarily toward the management of symptoms.Physical and speech therapy may improve the daily lives of patients, and 3-globulin injections can be given to support the immune system. However, no treatment is currently directed at the underlying defect. The development of improved therapies for A-T iscurrently limited by the lack of an animal model that fully and accurately recapitulates the multi-systemic nature of this disease. A number of mouse models of A-T have been developed by the targeted disruption of the mouse Atm gene and have proved invaluable for studying some aspects of ATM function and A-T disease. However, no single mouse model fully replicates the complex clinical symptoms observed in human disease, and more importantly, none of the mouse models develop the severe neurological phenotype that is the hallmark of human A-T. The failure of mouse models to develop the classical symptoms of A-T is likely the result of physiological, anatomical, and developmental differences between the two species. In contrast, pigs may serve as a better model in which to study human disease because their development, anatomy, and physiology are more closely related to that of humans. Given that the development and anatomy of the pig brain more closely resembles that of humans than mice, mutations in the porcine ATM gene may result in many of the same neurological changes that are observed in A-T patients. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop and commercialize a porcine model of A-T by disrupting the ATM gene. We intend to accomplish this in two steps by combining gene targeting and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). This proposal specifically outlines the development of porcine fibroblasts with mutated ATM alleles. Gene targeting vectors will be constructed to disrupt the endogenous porcine ATM gene in a region frequently mutated in patients. Porcine fetal fibroblasts will be infected with a virus carrying the ATM targeting vectors. Our plans for generating properly targeted cells are designed to maximize the frequency of homologous recombination,minimize random integration, and minimize the number of cell passages before targeted cells are harvested. Subsequent work will use these cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce ATM-targeted pigs and the subsequent characterization and validation of the pigs. This animal model will provide the academic and commercial research communities an opportunity to better understand the consequences of ATM dysfunction and the pathogenesis of A-T disease, and to develop and test new therapeutic strategies.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative This proposal specifically outlines the development of porcine fibroblasts with mutated ATM alleles as a first step towards a new model of the human disease, Ataxia-Telangiectasia. Subsequent work will usethese cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce affected pigs followed by characterization and validation of the animal model. This project is relevant to the NIH&#039;s mission because it will provide a resource to stimulate discovery, therapeutic application, and the development of new diagnostic tools."

Even though a number of new chemical entities have entered the marketplace, therapy resistant seizures remain. This project is innovative in that its goals are to create and test an entirely new set of small molecules with the prospect that lead compounds will exhibit protection against seizures in animal models and have reduced toxicity. Initial studies, conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Max Baker at the University of Iowa, showed that substitution at the para position of propofol, a commonly used sedative, yielded a compound having reduced anesthetic or sedative effects while maintaining anti-convulsant properties in the 6 Hz (32 mA) mouse model conducted at the Anti-convulsant Screening Program (ASP), NINDS. Propofol and this novel analog, 2,6-diisopropyl-4-(1-hydroxy-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)phenol (MB003), both exhibit lower ED50s than many other anti-convulsant drugs including valproic acid, felbamate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and ethosuximide. Therefore, the substantially reduced sedative activity for MB003 compared to propofol, allows for the possibility of wider use of this compound for seizure treatment. Currently, the structural elements of MB003 required for anti-seizure activity are not well understood, and so a concise and directed medicinal chemistry effort to deconvolute the structure-activity relationship is required in order to move this opportunity toward commercialization. This Proposal consists of two Aims: 1) create and execute a rational medicinal chemistry plan exploring structure-activity relationships around the propofol pharmacophore, and 2) test these compounds at the ASP, NINDS in models of seizures and sedation. The primary objective of this proposal is to identify a lead drug candidate with strong anti- convulsant efficacy with an acceptable side-effect profile. The ultimate goal of this research program (SBIR phase I, II and III) is to create a new oral anti-convulsant for chronic and prophylactic use.  Tansna Therapeutic Inc. was co-founded by the inventor of these compounds, Dr. Baker, to commercialize this technology by developing para-substituted analogs of propofol with good anti-convulsant properties. SARmont, LLC, is a drug discovery and design company, led by Dr. John Talley, the lead inventor of Celebrex(R) and 7 other NCEs that have made it to the marketplace. Tansna will contract SARmont to provide medicinal chemistry services, specifically in molecular design and structure-activity relationship analysis. Tansna and SARmont will collaborate on compound synthesis, and in vivo testing will occur at the NINDS. Success in this Proposal will lead to the submission of a Phase II grant focused on further medicinal chemistry optimization, more rigorous mammalian safety testing, and other pre-clinical studies required for IND submission.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 30% of epileptic patients are resistant to currentlyavailable therapeutic agents. Novel and effective anti-convulsants are needed to address this unmet medical need. Propofol is a general anesthetic known to have good anti-convulsant properties; however use of propofol as an anti-seizure medicine is limiteddue to its potent anesthetic/sedative properties. The primary objective of this Proposal is to identify a lead drug candidate with strong anti-convulsant efficacy with an acceptable side-effect profile."

At least one well- accepted underlying contributor to the pathophysiologic expression of asthma is an over-expressed and dysregulated T helper type 2 (Th2)-mediated immune response to various environmental antigens. Recent studies have shown that the pro-inflammatory, complement-derived component C5a plays an important role in regulating this Th2-dominated response in the airway in order to maintain a proper Th1/Th2 immune balance. These studies showed that C5a engages C5a receptor (C5aR)-bearing airway dendritic cells (DC) in sucha way as to downregulate this Th2 response and, apparently, allow for the expression and maintenance of a beneficial Th1/Th2 balance. Thus, a potential treatment approach for asthma would be the use of a C5a mimetic capable of upregulating Th1 cytokines via selective engagement of C5aR-bearing airway DCs as a way to re-establish and maintain this beneficial Th1/Th2 balance, but without engagement of C5aR-bearing airway-infiltrating inflammatory cells. Toward this end, a response-selective agonist of C5a known as EP67 has been developed. EP67 activates C5aR-bearing DCs to release Th1 cytokines yet lacks any ability to activate C5aR-bearing inflammatory neutrophils. The long-term goal of this project is to move EP67 along a commercialization pathway toward itsuse as a safe and effective method for treating asthma in humans. The main objective of this Phase I study, which is a crucial step in pursuit of this goal, is to demonstrate the potential protective effects of EP67 in vivo in well-established and human-relevant murine models of asthma. This objective will be approached by the following specific aims: 1) To demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of EP67 in preventing the induction of the Th2-biased airway inflammation and AHR utilizing acute allergen challenge models in mice; and 2) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of EP67 in reversing established airway inflammation and AHR utilizing chronic allergen exposure models in mice. This use of EP67 is significant, because it mediates the establishment of an immunologically beneficial Th1/Th2 environment and, consequently, could have a positive impact on the treatment of asthma by providing a safe and effective method of addressing an underlying cause of the disease by selectively enhancing the beneficial effects of C5a rather than indiscriminately blocking its deleterious effects. Other features of EP67 that support its innovative use as a commercial candidate for the treatment of asthma include: 1) the economy and ease of its production in large and highly purified quantities; 2) its long-term (years) stability at room temperature; 3) its high solubility in water; 4) its ease of administration intranasally; and 5) its lack of toxicity.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research is relevant to public healthbecause it will make available a convenient, effective, and unique way of treating allergic asthma - a disease that is on the rise worldwide. This disease target and treatment approach is relevant to the mission of the NIH that pertains to understanding the immunologic mechanisms responsible for allergic disorders and the development of therapeutics that could help treat these disorders."

A major obstacle to the effective management of these lesions involves the difficulty in delivering adequateconcentrations of therapeutics to the tumor cells. In addition, the inability to image the distribution of therapeutic agent hampers the planning of subsequent treatments. LNK Chemsolutions, LLC (LNK), a small business entity, and the University of Chicago Hospitals (UCH), have been engaged in the development of a novel polymeric nanoparticle (NP) for the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that NPs bearing magnetite within their shell, can i. be dispersedin the rodent brain by convection enhanced delivery (CED), ii. transport viable chemotherapeutic agent and iii. be visualized by standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The overall goal of our Phase II proposal is to incorporate the specific propertiesoutlined above to develop an NP that can be used for imaged-guided treatment of brain tumors. Throughout the study period, NPs will be manufactured at LNK and subsequently tested at UCH. In Aim 1, we will use both in vitro and animal models to critically examine NPs for targeting and delivery of chemotherapy and siRNA. After identifying a prototypical NP that has the necessary characteristics for in vivo targeting and therapy, we will next investigate potential toxic effects related to infusion of these NPsinto normal animal brains. In Aim 2, we will harness the ability of these polymeric, magnetite-bearing NPs (PMNPs) to be imaged by MRI, and test whether multiple imaged- guided treatments can improve the therapeutic response compared to unguided treatments. Following studies in rodents with glioma xenografts, in Aim 3 we will move on to study PMNPs in spontaneous canine gliomas. Dogs have significantly larger brains than rats and, more importantly, canine gliomas have many of the characteristics of human tumors. After examining PMNP toxicity in normal dogs, we will enroll companion dogs with spontaneous tumors into a specific protocol involving CED of chemotherapy encapsulated NPs. Animals will be treated and followed with real-time MR imaging and NP distribution pattern and animal survival documented. While the first 3 Aims are being completed at UCH, at LNK studies will concurrently be conducted to improve the EDH manufacturing technique specifically to optimize production of NPs that have characteristicsnecessary for CED (i.e. diameter lt  100 nm) (Aim 4). Following the completion of the above Aims, it is anticipated that we will have developed a method to efficiently manufacture a targeted nanoparticle vector that can be used to deliver a range of therapeutics for the treatment of malignant brain tumors. Importantly, such a product also has the potential to make a significant impact in the management of other diseases both in and outside of the nervous system.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposalfocuses on development of a core/shell nanoparticle for delivery of therapeutic agents for the treatment of malignant brain tumors. Important properties of these nanoparticles include their ability to be targeted to specific cells and to be imaged by routine MRI. As delivery of therapeutic agents to tumor cells is a major obstacle to the effective management of brain tumors, this vector system can make a significant impact in the management of this devastating disease."

Two platform technologies were developed.    Novel compositions that prevent vector-backbone mediated transgene silencing from  plasmid vectors (Anti-Silencing Elements: ASE platform)    Novel vector backbone functionalities that improve transgene expression from plasmid  vectors after transient transfection (transient expression enhancers: TEE platform) In Phase II we hypothesize that combining ASE and TEE vectors with state of the art plasmid delivery will create enabling vector-delivery platforms for gene therapy.

While agreat deal of progress has been made in the field of Drosophila sleep research using available tools, they are limited for the observation, recording and analysis of sleep (immobility) periods in the fruit fly. Additionally, no existing system is capable of individually sleep-depriving flies on an as- needed basis. This proposal outlines a system explicitly designed to measure small amounts of motion in the Drosophila and, as such, more accurately estimate sleep than any available system. In conjunction with this detection device we also propose the design of a mechanized system capable of automatically sleep depriving individual flies through a fully-programmable computerized interface. The system will also provide a flexible behavioral platform for the controlled introduction of modalities based on light, temperature, scent, sound, etc. Phase I of this proposal successfully demonstrated a device to record and analyze motion patterns and sleep as well as enforce wakefulness in individually housed flies. Phase II will build this prototype device into an automated, scalable, modular system capable of monitoring and sleep depriving 160+ flies housed within a commercial incubator. Accomplishment of this project will involve a collaborative effort between PinnacleTechnology and the world-renowned Drosophila research team at The University of Pennsylvania. Prototyping and design will continue to be undertaken by Pinnacle Technology while testing and refinement of the system will be accomplished by the University ofPennsylvania team. The combination of these two features specifically designed to record and automatically analyzes sleep in the fly, will provide a new and powerful tool for Drosophila researchers to explore the basic genetics underlying sleep. Technological innovations of this system will include enhanced video recognition software, mechanisms to observe multiple flies with a single video camera and the technology to selectively deprive individual flies of sleep. Control of individual fly sleep deprivation and real-time visualization of data will be available though a web-based control system. After completion, the system will be validated by testing with known sleep mutations and validated by a trained human observer. Commercial applications of such a device are already being sought by major pharmaceutical companies as they explore new potential gene products for targeted therapy.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that at least 40 million Americans suffer each year from chronic, long-term sleep disorders while an additional 20 million experience occasional sleeping problems. Economically, poor sleep accounts for an estimated  16 billion in medical costs each year and the indirect costs of lost productivity and other factors are known to be much higher. While the links between inadequate sleep and poor health and productivity are becoming clearer, there is a dire need to understand the basic causes and biological need for sleep."

Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of lipids, cholesterol, calcium deposits, and cellular debris in vessel walls, and results in plaque formation, arterial obstruction, and diminished blood flow to organs. These plaques often rupture, causing myocardial infarction, stroke, or death. The main risk factors include elevated lipid levels, hypertension, and diabetes. Current treatment strategies are directed at changing patient lifestyle/diet and decreasing cholesterol via pharmacological methods. Surgical interventions with medical devices such as stents are used for advanced cases. While these therapeutic approaches have benefited many patients with this disease, they are far from ideal. One reason is that no drug or device is actually developed and tested in a model system that accurately recreates the disease being treated. Thus, there is a significant gap between early phase preclinical studies and human drug trials. The lack of an animal model that accurately replicates all of the manifestations of human atherosclerosis has been a major barrier to the development of effective therapies and interventions for this deadly disease. Several mouse models have been generated with mutations in genes important for lipoprotein metabolism, and while these models have been informative, they fail to develop the complex atherosclerotic lesions that are typical of the human disease. In contrast to mice, the physiology and anatomy of the porcine cardiovascular system closely resembles that of humans. In fact, pigs have long been used as models of cardiovascular disease, and pigs with naturally occurring mutations in their LDL receptor (LDLR) gene, and therefore possessing elevated LDL, have been reported. Although the hypercholesterolemic pig is an attractive model, the mild nature of the mutation, the high variability of the disease, the limited access by other researchers, and the expense prevent its wide use in the research community. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this project is to develop and commercialize a gene- targeted porcine model of atherosclerosis. LDLR fetal fibroblasts that we developed in Phase I will be used as nuclear donors for somatic cell nuclear transfer. Nuclear transfer embryos will be transferred to recipient females for gestation. Resulting piglets will have one targeted LDLR gene. We will characterize the LDLR- targeted pigs at the molecular and biochemical level. We will determine the lipid and lipoprotein profile in LDLR-targeted pigs and perform morphometric analysis to determine the presence and extent of atherosclerosis. Finally, we will establish breeding herds to generate LDLR-/- pigs and to expand and propagate the colony. This project will produce a porcine model of atherosclerosis that will provide academic and industry researchers with an opportunity to better understand the disease and to develop and test new therapeutics and preventative strategies. Thus, this work will accelerate the discovery of novel therapies for this costly and deadly disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal specifically outlines the development, characterization and propagation of a genetically engineered porcine model of atherosclerosis. This project is relevant to the NIH&#039;s mission because it will provide a resource to stimulate discovery, therapeutic application, and the development of new diagnostic tools."

analysis on complex configurations as well as parallelize the solver in RotCFD to take advantage of today&#039;s
multi-core machines.

The principle idea behind the semi-automation of the grid generation is to divide the geometry surface into patches and
generate body-conforming grids from these patches.

This partitioning allows for automatic generation of grids with
aspect ratios suitable for viscous flows.

Convection dominates the outer region, so unstructured Cartesian meshes
can be generated quickly and easily here.

The outer grid will be conformed to the inner grid so the entire grid
can be treated as one unstructured grid with an unstructured
solver, or as a hybrid grid with multiple zones and solvers.

In the hybrid approach, viscous solvers can be used for the inner zone
while the faster inviscid solvers can be used in the far-field.

In Phase I a proof-of-concept grid generator, and a conceptual methodology for solver
parallelization will be developed and demonstrated to work with RotCFD the
rotor aerodynamic design tool.

In Phase II, the features of the grid generator and solver will
be fully developed and expanded."

RVFV is an arthropod-borne pathogen that often results in severe morbidity and mortality in both humans and livestock. RVF manifests itself in the vast majority of individuals that become infected. In fact, unlike a West Nile virus (WNV) infection, which has no clinical manifestation in 80% of infected individuals, approximately 90% of humans infected with RVF virus show clinical signs of the disease. While infections in humans are typically mild and present as self-limiting febrile illnesses, RVFV infections can progress to more severe disease including fulminant hepatitis, encephalitis, retinitis, blindness, or a hemorrhagic syndrome in approximately 2% of affected individuals. However, statistics from recent outbreaks suggest that the case fatality rate from RVFV infection is significantly increasing (up to 45%) in naive populations. Human RVFV infections are usually preceded by transmission from wild to domestic animal hosts, recognized by sudden and devastating impact on livestock. In sheep, mortality in lambs under 2 weeks of age approaches 100%, reaches 30% in older animals and abortions approach 100%. Cattle also show high abortion rates (up to 100%) with adult mortality averaging 10%. As RVFV&#039;s geographic range continues to spread, it presents a real threat to naive populations around the world by accidental introduction or a bioterror/agroterror event. The lack of prophylactic and therapeutic measures, the potential for human-to-human and animal-to-animal transmissions, and the significant threat to livestock associated with RVFV make infection with this pathogen a serious public health concern. RVFV epizootics and epidemics might rapidly overwhelm the capacities of the public health and veterinary medical communities to provide rapid diagnostic testing, distribution of countermeasures and adequate medical care. The development of safe and efficacious RVFV vaccines has proven to be quite difficult. Live-attenuated countermeasures have a high potential to revert to the deadly wildtype virus, while subunit candidates usually require several vaccination/boost regimens to initiate immunity. In addition, most of the tested live attenuated vaccine candidates do not follow the DIVA concept which makes it impossible to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals - a crucial feature in outbreak situations. The use of VLPs is a promising alternative approach for the development of a safe and efficient RVFV vaccine. RVF VLPs exhibit morphology similar to that of wild-type viruses and have wild type tropism with comparable cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking. VLPs present viral antigens in a native conformation allowing for effective recognized by the immune system. The VLP-based vaccine candidates against RVFV described in this proposal are safe, show high efficacy in two rodent models, and are therefore a promising concept to combat emerging RVFV."

Nozzles may be selected to provide a range of droplet sizes, spray distribution patterns, and flow rates for a desired liquid material application. Spray distribution, droplet size, and flow rate are important considerations in achieving a high quality agrochemical application. The size of the droplets and application conditions can influence the target coverage and the occurrence of spray drift, where droplets are displaced by ambient wind and subsequently land outside of the designated spray area. It has been shown that uniform deposition of small droplets can result in superior pest control efficacy. However, large droplets are less likely to drift than small droplets. Spray droplet size is the most important factor affecting the likelihood of spray drift and target coverage from conventional spray nozzles. The capability of pulse width modulated (PWM) flow control at individual nozzles can result in fewer application rate errors due to adjustment to the rate at the highest possible spatial resolution. However, the quality of an application is dependent on many other factors than only the quantity of material applied. Spray droplet size remains a critical ingredient in maximizing efficacy and minimizing drift. But, even with modern PWM flow control systems, droplet size on existing systems is controlled in per-machine width resolution, that is, every nozzle across the entire boom must produce the same droplet size spectrum. There are many situations where adjusting the droplet size on an individual nozzle is desirable, including use in narrow buffer zones where a larger droplet size is mandated for mitigating spray drift. With current technology, a spray machine with a 40 m boom would be required to maintain large droplets on a 40 m swath, even if the mandated buffer zone was only 3 m. This application would reduce the efficacy of the application in areas not at risk of drift. Modern global positioning systems with centimeter-scale accuracy and high-speed computers are capable of implementing very precise applications for diverse crops in close proximity. To gain full use of these sensor and processing technologies, the need for high treatable spatial resolution is increasing. However, one of the primary limitations to precision agricultural technology is the lack of good actuation systems to match the precision of today&#039;s advanced sensing systems. The basic premise of this project is a PWM-based valve in which the electromechanics of the valve and the driver electronics are designed to allow the valve to be partially opened, in a precisely and reliably controllable manner during each pulse of emitted spray. In this manner, the liquid pressure drop across the valve can be controlled, this controlling the inlet pressure to a spray nozzle and therefore, the spray droplet size. This control, when coupled with the existing PWM-based control of the flow rate of liquid, allows complete control, on a nozzle-by-nozzle basis, of spray application rate and droplet size of agricultural spray"

Current production practices focus on pathogen exclusion by stocking specific pathogen free (SPF) larvae, decontamination and filtration of water to prevent pathogen introduction, and strict biosecurity at hatcheries and grow out pond sites. This is extremely challenging due to the prevalence of WSSV in estuarine waters in shrimp producing areas, resulting in devastating financial losses, even in SPF populations. WSSV was first discovered in 1992 after several outbreaks of a high mortality disease occurred in shrimp farms in Taiwan. Within a decade it has spread throughout the world and is now endemic in most shrimp producing areas. WSSV has a wide host range of over 50 separate species including all penaeids and crayfish. In the United States, a 2007 APHIS study showed that 66% of tested samples were positive and it has been declared endemic by the state veterinarian and OIE in the Louisiana freshwater crayfish population. The combined economic impact of WSSV in farmed shrimp is tremendous. It is estimated that Asia alone has lost over $6 billion since 1992, and the Americas about $1-2 billion since WSSV introduction in 1999 with countries such as Ecuador showing the greatest economic impact. In addition to the tremendous economic effect on shrimp production, there is a rising concern for an introduction of WSSV into native crustacean species. Avenues exist for the introduction of WSSV into naive species such as reprocessing of frozen emergency harvested product or animal movement. In addition, the United States possesses over 350 of the estimated 500 species worldwide of crayfish species. In North America, 65 out of the estimated 400 resident species are endangered and half of these are listed as needing protection. The outcome of the proposed project would be the first effective commercially available vaccines that protect against disease caused by WSSV in shrimp. Harrisvaccines intends to market vaccine to be used in two different shrimp production settings. First, an injectable vaccine for adult breeding females will be targeted to SPF production companies and larger integrated intensive shrimp producers abroad who possess their own hatcheries for the purpose of restocking their ponds. The second would be an orally administered vaccine for post larvae (PL) shrimp that would aid in protection of the shrimp prior to entry into the ponds. This accomplishes disease prevention in the hatcheries as well as the ponds. The goal is to prevent disease that can cause increases in the variable costs of raising shrimp. In addition to the observable clinical signs of disease, WSSV is directly responsible for a reduction of feed conversion rates which result in increased feed costs and a reduction in harvest weight combined with 70-100% mortality. The costs associated with restocking ponds lost to disease add to this devastation. A vaccine against WSSV is undoubtedly a valuable insurance for the investment of shrimp rearing."

Successful Phase I results included demonstration of the ability to provide up to 150 mg of calcium per serving of Bibb lettuce, a level high enough to qualify the lettuce as a ""good"" source of calcium under FDA guidelines and more than eight times the amount of calcium available in commercial lettuce today, using a combination of bioengineering and novel hydroponic techniques. Moreover, most of the calcium in the lettuce is present in a bioavailable form that is efficiently processed by the body. In Phase II, elite commercial lettuce varieties provided by a leading commercial seed company will be transformed, hydroponic growing protocols will be optimized, a pilot demonstration will be conducted at a commercial hydroponic lettuce grower, and product quality testing including taste testing will be conducted by a university partner. Successful completion of the project will lay the foundation for introduction of a new value-added crop that provides better nutrition for consumers and a new source of income for agricultural producers.

This proposal details the development of a quasi-passive, solid state electro-optic terminal protection system (EOTPS) to effectively block UWB and HPM signals from the front end of radar systems.  The device uses power from the incoming transient to switch the signal line to ground.  But because the system as a whole requires no external power other than the transient, it can be considered a passive device.  Inherent delay in the system permits the switch to become fully conductive before the transient arrives, effectively creating a system with a negative switching time.  This allows the entire transient to be reflected, in contrast to other high power terminal protection techniques which allow part of the transient to pass to the LNA."

However, almost no available antibodies recognize site  specific glycosylation, and in particular, N-acetylglycosamine modification of serines and threonines (O-GlcNAc).  Possible reasons for this are poor immunogenicity in animals, or that antibodies are not appropriate for recognizing OGlcNAc  in a site specific fashion. These limitations may make it extremely challenging to generate site-specific anti-OGlcNAc  antibodies with sufficient affinity and selectivityto be useful research tools.

The system will be designed to perform comprehensive pattern analysis of state-of-the-art biochemical separations generated by comprehensive two-dimensional chromatography (GCxGC) with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The pairing of GCxGC and HRMS combines highly effective molecular separations with precise elemental analysis. A critical challenge for effective utilization of GCxGC-HRMS for biochemical sample classification and biomarker discovery is the difficulty of analyzing and interpreting the massive, complex data for metabolomic features. The quantity and complexity of the data, as well as the large dimensionality of the metabolome, and the possibility that significant chemical characteristics may be subtle and involve patterns of multiple constituents, necessitate investigation and development of new bioinformatics. The principal technical objective is an innovative framework for comprehensive feature matching and analysis across many samples. Specifically, the framework will incorporate advanced methods for multidimensional peak detection, peak pattern matching across large sample sets, data alignment, comprehensive feature matching, and multi-sample analyses (e.g., classification and biomarker discovery) with large sample sets. The anticipated result is a commercial system for automated multi-sample analysis. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be realized through improved informatics for biological classification and biomarker discovery. These tools will enable researchers to better understand biochemical processes and to discover metabolic biomarkers, which could lead to improved methods for disease diagnoses and treatments. These information technologies will foster utilization of advanced GCxGC-HRMS instrumentation, thereby contributing to the impetus for future instrument development. The informatics developed in this project also will be relevant for other classification problems involving multidimensional, multispectral data, including other applications (such as biofuels), other types of chemical analyses (such as multidimensional spectroscopy), and other fields (such as remote-sensing multispectral geospatial imagers).

In this system, each aircraft determines its location using GPS, and broadcasts this to other local traffic and ground stations, along with other flight data (aircraft ID, speed, heading, flight number, altitude, etc). This endows local traffic with high situational awareness, enabling greater security, efficiency and airspace capacity. However, ADS-B can be effectively spoofed using a simple ADS-B transmitter driven by a computer and a GPS simulator program. For the DoD, the issue is one of denial of airspace access: an adversary can put up phantom traffic in a contested airspace, thus preventing allied aircraft from entering. Therefore, there is an immediate need for airborne military aircraft to be able to detect spoofed ADS-B reports in real time, in a stand-alone manner. In this SBIR project, KalScott Engineering is developing and demonstrating a method to detect spoofing of ADS-B reports using airborne signals intelligence (SIGINT) techniques.

The challenge is in finding useful bits in terabytes of data that directly relate to the nature of time-varying, multivariate data. An intelligent data mining capability is needed that has both knowledge (descriptive physics) and foresight (cognitive model of users’ needs). Concurrent Agent-enabled Feature Extraction (CAFÉ), from 21st Century Systems, Inc. and Brigham Young University, will address this challenge. CAFÉ features 21CSI’s intelligent agent technologies that leverage BYU’s expertise. CAFÉ’s innovative intelligent agent structure and evidential inference engine will allow concurrent data-mining, making it possible for multiple analysis methods to work together to improve the data-mining performance. This phase implements a bottom-up clustering algorithm to help tune feature extraction and predict features well before the simulation has converged. The agent design allows direct collaboration between data-mining algorithms and scientist. CAFÉ allows the scientist to observe and correct data-mining of simulations without wasting valuable research time. With our impressive track record of transitioning technology (100th percentile DoD commercialization index) and our strong team, we are the right team to provide intelligently guided concurrent data-mining for high fidelity fluid dynamic simulations.  BENEFIT:  Current costs to develop a new aircraft engine are more than $2 billion and 10 years. While the Air Force and other services don’t develop these components internally, the development of a new aircraft engine or airframe can have significant military application. University researchers and commercial contractors perform the lion’s share of this type of work. A better understanding of the complexities of the component and its interactions could have a significant impact in extending the envelope of current aircraft and in the development of new aircraft. CAFÉ offers the capability to perform intelligent concurrent data-mining for high fidelity fluid dynamic simulations. The CAFÉ tool is able to extract and display accurate, near real-time patterns from massively large data sets by searching for physics-related events in complex large scale simulations.  With CAFÉ, the potential exists to go even further through the interaction of concurrent, on-the-fly, queries and responses among the CAFÉ agents as well as with the human operator. The primary target customer will be the CFD researcher at the research institution or commercial entity. Initially, the CAFÉ tool will be tailored to simulations of fans and compressors of gas turbine engines.  In order to minimize overall technical risk while at the same time reducing physical testing costs, aircraft manufactures continuously search for computational design tools to remain competitive. They rely heavily on continual advancement of the technological frontier for faster solutions to more complex problems, more accurate results with improved performance, enhanced safety, environmental acceptability, and less time involved to develop new products. 21CSI recognizes these challenges facing aircraft manufactures. The computational models developed under CAFÉ will significantly accelerate the testing cycle allowing more efficiency in the design processes used to develop various types of flight vehicles. Using these tools, aircraft engineers and designers can address a wide range of design challenges including airfoil and geometry selection, wake vortex alleviation, flutter aero-elastics, load design, stability and control, and high-speed wing design. Businesses will be easily able to justify the CAFÉ software expense with the time saving that achieve."

Significant video degrading is caused by clouds, haze, and dust in the atmosphere; jitter and blurring from the UAV platform motion; and low video resolution due to sensor characteristics and high altitude flying. Higher quality video would alleviate much of the challenge for the operator, increasing the likelihood that they will detect and identify targets and increase their confidence in the presence and type of targets.  Improving the quality of video would also increase the autonomous detection and tracking capabilities that support the operator’s ability to interpret the images and make timely decisions. 21st Century Systems, Incorporated is excited to continue to apply our extensive video analytics expertise in developing Video20/20, an innovative real-time EO/IR video-enhancement toolset.   Video20/20 is a set of software tools that provide real-time quality video with higher resolution and contrast enhancement making it easier to detect and distinguish enemy activities in video collected from UAV platforms.  And, with an SBIR commercialization rating second-to-none, we are just the company to deliver this capability to the warfighter.     BENEFIT:  There is an immediate need for this video enhancement capability in all branches of the DoD. Unmanned Systems technology has been revolutionized during the current OIF and OEF conflicts, and we can expect to see even more of them in future conflicts. UAVs have performed thousands of ISR missions (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) in support of ongoing operations. They have greatly expanded the level of real-time intelligence available to the warfighter.  Despite the many recent advances in Unmanned Systems technology, there are many technical challenges yet to overcome. The limitation of the value of any ISR platform is the ability of a human operator to interpret actionable intelligence from the video stream. Soldiers, Airmen, and Image Analysts are currently hampered by video that is often low-quality and difficult to interpret. By developing a tool that can improve image quality, we can greatly improve the tactical value of every Micro and Small UAV in service.  Our system will enable a next-generation capability for UAV operation. It will allow an operator to interpret data from a single UAV much more easily, with less fatigue and eyestrain, and provide greater situational awareness than existing systems. It will also allow the same operator to more easily monitor multiple UAV video streams and be able to interpret and act on them with minimal effort. By cleaning up the imagery, the operator will be able to maintain a much greater understanding of the ground situation with less effort on their part. Video enhancement tools are a key piece to achieving object detection and tracking. For example, in Iraq, a national curfew is in place in the evening prohibiting civilians from being out. Many of the IED’s are emplaced in the dark after the curfew. Having auto detection and tracking of humans would enable the warfighter to use multiple UAV’s in patrolling an area and alert on any people that are detected after curfew. One operator could monitor multiple UAV video streams and be able to interpret and act on them with minimal effort. This would minimize the manpower requirements and maximize the detection of curfew violators enabling strict enforcement of the curfew and, as a result, saving lives."

A problem with conventional mesa diode processing approaches is that nonradiative surface recombination at the exposed pn junction is extremely rapid, leading to surface leakage currents that limit the mesa diode performance.  By eliminating etched sidewalls through planar processing, we expect edge leakage current to be greatly reduced without compromising areal leakage currents.  Planar processing using sealed ampoules or a pseudo-closed box approach requires strict control of the partial pressures is required to obtain reproducible diffusion profiles and to avoid surface damage in both of these approaches.  An alternative approach which we propose to follow is the open-tube diffusion from doped spin-on films, which are commercially available for a variety of dopant species, including  zinc.  We believe diffusion of zinc from spin on SiOx presents a simpler, more manufacturable approach to planar processing focal plane arrays than the ampoule approach or the pseudo-closed box approach."

The tunable laser is based on a 2.4 micron wavelength laser diode that utilizes antimonide III-V semiconductor materials and is coupled to an external cavity. A high-brightness source will be a great aid for spectroscopy in turbid solutions with low optical throughput like whole blood. The tunable laser spectrometer will have significantly higher brightness than is available with conventional broad-band sources. The wide tunability required to differentiate the spectral signatures of the target analytes from those of other biomolecules will be achieved first by broadening the gain spectrum through a series of quantum wells with staggered emission wavelengths, and second, by fabricating laser devices using a curved-waveguide geometry to suppress optical feedback from the laser diode facets. An intracavity, temperature-controlled acousto-optic tunable filter will provide the necessary wavelength stability and tuning range, giving the instrument a rugged, compact, all-solid state design with no moving parts.  The tunable laser diode will enable direct spectroscopic measurements in small volumes of whole blood.
The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to significantly enhance patient care. The point-of-care monitor based on this tunable laser spectrometer will provide automated measurement of key blood metabolites at the bedside and semi-continuous monitoring of metabolic status. The monitor will periodically collect absorption spectra of a small blood sample, and reinfuse the blood into the patient through an arterial catheter, allowing regular monitoring of glucose, urea, creatinine and lactate.  Regular monitoring of glucose enables the use of intensive insulin therapy, which has been shown to improve the outcome of intensive care unit patients. Tracking urea and creatinine concentrations provides a measure of renal function that can be used for early identification of acute kidney failure. Detection of elevated lactate concentrations can be used as an indicator of metabolic distress for unstable patients. The tunable laser-based point-of-care monitor can provide more information than is available now without increasing costs. Unlike standard blood chemistry assays, optical measurements do not require reagents, so there is no incremental cost to limit the frequency of monitoring. Since the measurement results in no blood loss, it is safe to use in patients who would be intolerant of frequent blood draws."

Several human pathogenic arenaviruses, e.g., Lassa and Junin viruses, are listed on the NIAID's Priority Pathogens and CDC's Bioterrorism Agents Lists and can cause a deadly hemorrhagic fever. No effective and safe vaccine is currently available to combat these diseases. In addition, effective arenavirus vaccines are needed for the Strategic National Stockpile in preparation for a potential bioterror attack in the United States. A commonly used, safe vaccine platform based on the Yellow fever (YF) vaccine 17D will be exploited to generate a protective vaccine against arenaviral infections.  The live-attenuated YF-17D virus vaccine strain has been used for human immunization since 1936. More than 500 million people have been vaccinated with YF-17D over the past 70 years, and the vaccine has a truly remarkable record of safety and efficacy. A single subcutaneous immunization with YF-17D elicits long-lasting protective antibodies and cellular immune responses. We will use this vaccine platform to generate multivalent arenavirus vaccines protecting against YFV and different arenaviruses. This new vaccine approach represents an important upgrade/replacement for the standard YF-17D vaccine that will provide immunity to both YF and important arenaviruses.  Besides the overall known safety of the vaccine platform, the published proof of concept for the use of this platform to protect against a deadly arenavirus, and the advantage of targeting different viral diseases in a similar geographical location (e.g., YF and Lassa fever - Lassa virus in West Africa; YF and Argentine hemorrhagic fever- Junmn virus in South America) makes this approach ideal as a prophylactic treatment for protecting indogenous populations, travelers and warfighters.  Importantly, the multivalent YF-17D vaccine platform is readily adaptable for the generation of immunity to other viral families, such as bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus) and henipaviruses (Nipah virus, Hendra virus), all of which present (i) a real threat to the indigenous populations and travelers in locations including Africa, Middle East and Southeast Asia, and (ii) a bioterror threat to the United States and its allies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Yellow fever viruses and arenaviruses (e.g., Junin, Lassa) that cause hemorrhagic fever (HF) are serious health concerns - as emerging diseases as well as bioterror threats. We will use the safe and approved Yellow Fever 17D vaccine as a platform to develop a multivalent Yellow fever-arenavirus vaccine. This new multivalent vaccine will simultaneously protect against several hemorrhagic fever-causing pathogens."

Ultrasound techniques have the potential to benefit the swine industry for improvements in both quality and yield measures by non-destructive and non-invasive means. Biotronics, Inc. has developed and markets products for evaluation of percent intramuscular fat (% IMF) in longissimus dorsi muscle and body composition traits in live pigs using conventional real-time ultrasound (B-mode) imaging technology. It has recently introduced this technology in a commercial prototype for hot carcass instrument grading. The premise of the project is that swine breeders can be rewarded financially for production of pigs resulting in higher levels of % IMF if the pork packing plant realizes premiums for their product. There is a need to continually improve accuracy and reduce bias for estimation of % IMF, especially for integration of % IMF levels into payment systems. The overall objective of this SBIR project is to significantly improve the % IMF and % lean evaluation by utilizing the new hybrid digital ultrasound technology. A unique opportunity exists due to recent availability of a programmable ultrasound scanner with access to both unprocessed, radio frequency (RF) ultrasound backscattered signals and corresponding B-mode images, and recent reports that combining parameters from both signals and images improves accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for tissue characterization. The Phase-I of this project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of simultaneously acquiring ultrasound images and RF signals from live pigs using a new generation of programmable digital ultrasound scanner and demonstrated greater than 10% improvements in % IMF estimation accuracy by combining parameters from RF signals with texture parameters from images. During the Phase-II, we will assemble a commercial prototype of the hybrid system for hot carcass instrument grading and will test the system in the packing plant by scanning carcasses at a line speed of 1200 per hour. We will refine the methods for real-time acquisition and processing of hybrid ultrasound signal, spectrum and image data. We will implement algorithms for fully automatic and accurate determination of % IMF and % lean, in near real-time at the line speed, by automatically identifying acceptable quality data frames and anatomical landmarks. Benefits of the proposed next generation system will include significant improvement in % IMF in an overall customized system design that integrates digital ultrasound and computer into one device and reduces the number of components. This will also lead to better quality control and longer lifecycle of the proposed commercial carcass instrument grading system. The Biotronics team is in unique position to lead this effort to develop the next generation ultrasound meat quality evaluation system. The proposed hybrid system has the potential to significantly improve marketable ultrasound technology and have a long lasting economic impact on all segments of the pork industry, with the ultimate benefit to be realized by the consumer."

However, it can also create environmental contamination if pesticides reach non-target areas through airborne displacement of spray, i.e., ""spray drift"". Drift is a concern for agriculture, especially for specialty crops grown in sensitive areas. Spray drift mitigation, through use of larger droplets, unsprayed buffer zones and slower ground speeds can conflict with efficient, economic crop production. Concurrently, precision pesticide application using GPS, sensors, etc., is growing; yet spray actuators can be the limiting factor in spatial resolution. This project will develop a single, at-nozzle actuator to control the application rate and spray droplet size at the spatial resolution of a single nozzle, allowing highly precise variable rate application and drift control. This will also allow buffer zones to be highly resolved and drift control to be electronically verified. The approach will be to develop a high-speed pulse width modulated (PWM) valve that can be partially opened during each pulse cycle. The duty cycle of pulses will control the flow rate while the modulated opening will control the pressure drop across the valve and correspondingly, the spray droplet size from the attached nozzle. This is a significant advance in spraying capability; yet, it will leverage the existing market acceptance of PWM spray rate control."

An article in InformationWeek highlighted the problem: ""More electronic records were exposed in 2008 than in the previous four years combined and most of those breaches -- nine out of 10 -- could have been easily avoided with basic preventative controls consistently applied"". Small and medium-sized entities (SMEs) have a wealth of private data that cyber thieves are targeting with increasingly regularity. Identity theft is the fastest growing crime in America and the risks of not protecting such information can be catastrophic to SMEs in rural communities. The Ponemon Institute calculates that in 2008, businesses paid an average of $202 per record compromised. That equates to $100,000 for an SME with 500 customers records. SMEs who cannot securely manage customer data from identity theft face either closure or acquisition by larger metropolitan-based organizations that have in-house IT security. SBS proposes to test the feasibility of creating an information security management system that could provide a basic level of information protection for rural SMEs. Deployment of such a system would protect rural citizens and the SMEs rural communities depend on for jobs and leadership within the community. The ability to securely manage customer data helps sustain rural SMEs and lessens the chance selling out to larger non-rural companies. The project would lead to 25 new jobs in rural Madison, SD and help sustain companies in rural areas of the U.S. This project represents a significant step forward for rural SMEs in America. The public's interests are well represented through the creation and preservation of jobs in rural parts of the U.S. As rural SMEs come under significant cyber attacks, and as the federal government is looking for ways to fortify the SME infrastructure they do not control, this project is timely to represent the public's interest in improving the security of non-public information and better securing the critical infrastructure citizens depend upon each day. Identify theft is a national crisis, and most experts believe it will get significantly worse before it gets marginally better. SBS is proposing high-quality research and development to understand the scientific issues associated with information security management systems in rural SMEs which could lead to less identity theft and domestic terrorism. These are important problems, and very few companies have the expertise to conduct this research and create solutions that could lead to this type of significant public benefit. America is at war, and many experts worry that the next big war will be a cyber war. Identity theft is spiraling out of control. Most of us know someone who has been an identity theft victim as the statistics are startling. The cost for the business to overcome a data breach is staggering, and the inconvenience and embarrassment that ensues for years after an identity theft is significant. The specific USDA strategic goal addressed by this proposal is Strategic Goal 3: Support Increased Economic Opportunities and Improved Quality of Life in Rural America."

The foci of the four programs will be (1) basic paragraph-writing skills, (2) advanced paragraph-writing skills, (3) basic essay-writing skills, and (4) advanced essay-writing skills. The lessons within each program will include an introduction to the program and the targeted writing skills, a description of how to use a targeted writing strategy, demonstrations, practice activities, and feedback. The Phase I project will focus on the feasibility of this medium for teaching complex writing skills to struggling writers. Measures will focus on (a) student use of the program, (b) student knowledge of writing skills, (c) student writing skills related to writing topic, detail, and concluding sentences within a paragraph, and (d) student satisfaction. During Phase I, an informal and a formal pilot test will be conducted to determine the feasibility of the prototype program. During each of the three years of Phase II, at least one informal pilot test and one field test of one new program will be conducted. A pretest-posttest control-group design with random assignment of students to groups will be utilized in each field test to determine the effects of each instructional program on student knowledge, performance, and generalization of the writing skills to complete writing tasks. The programs resulting from this project, because they will be designed to include instructional methods that have been found to be successful with at-risk students, should enable these students to respond successfully to the writing demands of their courses and minimum competency tests. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to public health because the number of individuals with low literacy skills is substantial. Low literacy has been associated with dropping out of school and such poor adult outcomes as under-employment and unemployment, criminal activity, and poverty (van Der Veen and Preece, 2005). Moreover, individuals who drop out of school have more mental and physical health problems than individuals who complete high school (Carter, 1998). Students who are at-risk for dropping out of school often have writing skill deficits. Only about half of their sentences are complete sentences. They do not know how to organize and write basic paragraphs and essays, and they are not able to respond to the writing demands of their required courses. A large number of these students will either drop out of school or continue to struggle with writing tasks throughout their school careers and into adulthood. The empirically validated IM products that will result from this project will address the potentially devastating effects that low literacy can cause in children's lives and in society at large. Indeed, about a third of all students and half of all blacks, Latinos, and American Indians are currently failing to graduate from high school on time (Freudenberg and Ruglis, 2007). Since writing skills are needed for success in secondary and post-secondary educational settings and work settings, this project has the potential to help many individuals to succeed and have a better prospect for mental health. The instruction would be used to help struggling writers learn to create a variety of paragraphs and essays. The instructional programs that will result from this project will be usable as literacy intervention programs based on individual needs. In addition, the proposed programs will serve as a model for the development of future IM programs."

The technology is aimed to reduce polyp miss rates during colonoscopy. Colonoscopy has contributed to a marked decline in colorectal cancer related deaths.  However, recent data suggest that there is a significant miss rate for the detection of even large polyps and cancers.  Studies suggest that polyp detection rate may be related to the duration of the withdrawal phase of the procedure and cancer miss rate is related to the identity of the endoscopist performing the procedure. This tool, which will provide video stream analysis and feedback during live colonoscopy, is made up of novel middleware software to ensure high performance execution of video analysis on an affordable workstation, and are generic, reconfigurable with new task allocation that support time-constraint video analysis.  Objective metrics for real-time feedback are derived from real time analysis that will address complexities arising from blurry frames, stool, camera movement patterns, and regions of appendiceal orifice and polyps.  Technical insights learned from development of this tool for colonoscopy may be applicable to new research on quality control using videos generated in other areas of medicine, such as bronchoscopy, cystoscopy, arthroscopy and laparoscopy.
The broader/commercial impact of this project, if successfully implemented in large-scale day-to-day medical settings, will be higher quality of care for patients undergoing colonoscopy procedures with real time objective quality assessment, which is currently not feasible.  Over 14 million colonoscopies are performed annually in the US.  This assistive tool will stimulate high quality inspection, while documentation is done.  That will mean that endoscopists will be able to spend more time on performing the colonoscopy and less time on documentation.  Hospital/clinic administrators will be able to run endoscopic facilities more efficiently.  Insurance companies may benefit from better documentation and lower costs since fewer patients will require extensive cancer treatment as the frequency of missed polyps and early cancers declines. This assistive tool is also expected to contribute to medical education, research, and practice by providing automated feedback during teaching and training of novice endoscopists or continuing education for experienced endoscopists."

Force-based devices, enabled by magnetostrictive materials, can harvest energy over an extremely large bandwidth, approximately ±35 and ±70 Hz currently, making them more desirable in situations aboard Navy ships were transient vibration conditions created by varying ship speeds is present. This broader bandwidth also means easier installation of the devices without the need for exact placement on the vibration source and eliminating tuning requirements typical of the displacement based devices.  The robustness and formability that Galfenol alloys exhibit allow 1-dimensional (1D), 2-dimensional (2D), and 3-dimensional (3D) energy harvesting devices to be developed and optimized for the identified need and vibration coupling scheme. A 1D Galfenol device could consist of wire(s) bundled together to form an energy harvesting cable that could be wrapped around a vibrating column; a 2D Galfenol device could consist of a single Galfenol sheet attached to a vibrating panel; and a 3D Galfenol device could consist of structural support on-which the vibration source is mounted. The proposed work will investigate 1D and 2D Galfenol energy harvesting devices in Navy ship environments."

The CFTR gene encodes a chloride channel that regulates ion flow across epithelial cell membranes. Most CF patients have a mutation that deletes phenylalanine 508 (?F508) and prevents CFTR from being properly processed and delivered to cell membranes. Failure of CFTR to reach the cell surface in the lung disrupts the composition and quantity of the airway surface liquid, and through mechanisms not yet fully understood, begins a cascade of events that leads to chronic airway infection and inflammation and lung destruction. Despite improvements in the lives of patients with CF, it remains a lethal disease, and current treatments are directed at secondary manifestations rather than the underlying defect. Several studies have demonstrated that the ?F508-CFTR channel retains chloride channel function when it is experimentally delivered to the cell membrane. Thus, the ?F508-CFTR channel has become an important therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention. However, two barriers limit progress toward new treatments. First, lack of an animal model that develops lung disease is a major impediment to understanding disease pathogenesis and the development of effective therapies. Mice with CFTR knockouts and with the ?F508 mutation have been developed, but they fail to exhibit the airway infection and inflammation that cause most of the morbidity and mortality in patients. Second, the ?F508-CFTR protein from other species shows differences in its processing compared to human ?F508-CFTR. Thus, studies focused on understanding CF and developing new treatments require a new animal model expressing the human ?F508-CFTR. In this application, we propose to produce such a model. We will use pigs for this project, because in contrast to mice, the structure, physiology, and biochemistry of their lungs and airways closely resemble those of humans. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop and commercialize a porcine model of CF carrying a human CFTR transgene bearing the common ?F508 mutation. A  humanized  ?F508 pig would be the ideal model in which to develop and test CF drugs and a valuable tool for answering persistent questions about CF pathogenesis. This proposal outlines the development of such a pig by first stably introducing the entire human CFTR gene bearing the ?F508 mutation into the genome of pig cells lacking endogenous pig CFTR expression. The transgenic cells will then be used as nuclear donors for somatic cell nuclear transfer. The resulting pigs will be characterized molecularly, biochemically, and electrophysiologically to determine ?F508-CFTR expression and function. To validate the human ?F508-CFTR transgenic pig as a relevant model in which to test new therapies, pig airway cultures will be established, and compounds known to partially rescue the processing of ?F508-CFTR in human tissues will be tested. This project will generate an animal model that will provide the CF industrial and academic community with an opportunity to better understand the disease and its pathogenesis and to develop and test new therapeutics and preventative strategies. Thus, this work will accelerate the discovery of novel therapies for this lethal disease.

Atherosclerosis is characterized by the accumulation of lipids, cholesterol, calcium deposits, and cellular debris in vessel walls, and results in plaque formation, arterial obstruction, and diminished blood flow to organs. These plaques often rupture, causing myocardial infarction, stroke, or death. The main risk factors include elevated lipid levels, hypertension, and diabetes. Current treatment strategies are directed at changing patient lifestyle/diet and decreasing cholesterol via pharmacological methods. Surgical interventions with medical devices such as stents are used for advanced cases. While these therapeutic approaches have benefited many patients with this disease, they are far from ideal. One reason is that no drug or device is actually developed and tested in a model system that accurately recreates the disease being treated. The lack of an animal model that accurately replicates all of the manifestations of human atherosclerosis has been a major barrier to the development of effective therapies for this deadly disease. Several mouse models have been generated with mutations in genes important for lipoprotein metabolism, and while these models have been informative, they fail to develop the complex atherosclerotic lesions that are typical of the human disease. In contrast to mice, the physiology and anatomy of the porcine cardiovascular system closely resembles that of humans. In fact, pigs have long been used as models of cardiovascular disease, and pigs with naturally occurring mutations in their LDL receptor (LDLR) gene, and therefore possessing elevated LDL, have been reported. Although the hypercholesterolemic pig is an attractive model, the mild nature of the mutation, the high variability of the disease and the limited access by other researchers prevents its wide use in the research community. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this project is to develop and commercialize a gene- targeted porcine model of atherosclerosis. This proposal specifically outlines the development of porcine fibroblasts with a disrupted LDLR gene. A gene targeting vector will be constructed to disrupt the coding region of LDLR. Pig fetal fibroblasts will be infected with a virus carrying the LDLR targeting vector. Our plans for generating properly targeted cells are designed to maximize the frequency of homologous recombination, minimize random integration, and minimize the number of cell passages before targeted cells are harvested. Subsequent work will use these cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce a porcine model of atherosclerosis. This animal model will provide academic and industrial research communities with an opportunity to better understand the disease and its pathogenesis and to develop and test new therapeutics and preventative strategies.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposal specifically outlines the development of porcine fibroblasts with a disrupted LDLR gene as a first step towards a new model of atherosclerosis. Subsequent work will use these cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce pigs with elevated cholesterol.

The proposed research will investigate the opportunity to process a new soybean variety that has been traditionally bred (not genetically modified) to eliminate and/or significantly reduce these anti-nutrition factors. This research will investigate applying new and new-to-this-use, simpler, ambient or cool, less energy intensive processing in combination with these new soybean varieties to create feeds and feed ingredients with improved protein quality. Applying ambient processing technologies to these soybeans to deliver the next generation of soybean food ingredients and/or feed components is a key step in realizing the full commercial benefit of this material. Proof of concept work has been conducted in various university labs using bench-top processes (Herkelman, 1992) that must be validated with research and development using small pilot-plant and commercial scale processes. In this Phase II project we will again use small-scale processing to further the validation of the concept with the next generation of low trypsin inhibitor soybean and reduced oligosaccharide soybean. We will complete digestibility studies on the second generation RTI soybean in poultry and swine and with reduced oligosaccharides (ROS) soybeans in poultry. This will be followed by controlled, lab-scale feeding trials in swine and poultry research facilities at collaborating universities to validate the acceptability of ambient processed soybeans in monogastric diets. Then, in year two, we?ll scale up to pre-commercial feeding trials with livestock feeders as larger quantities of these soybeans become available ? to demonstrate commercial viability in preparation for commercial rollout in 2012-13. This will scale up to truckload quantities and allow validation of both commercial processing and feed efficacy. In summary, this research and development will demonstrate and validate the combined benefits of reduced trypsin inhibitor (RTI) soybeans, low oligosaccharide (LOS) soybeans, and ambient, non-thermal temperature processing to create a new generation of soy ingredients for feed (and possible future food) use by means that require less energy use than conventional soy products."

Developing reagents that can selectively alter the expression level of any desired gene has been a goal of both scientists and clinicians for years. Historically, the most common approach was based on antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that encompass a broad variety of mechanisms that have in common an oligonucleotide designed to base pair with its complementary target mRNA leading to either degradation or impaired function of the mRNA. Classically, ASOs were designed to interfere with translation of the target mRNA or induce its degradation via RNase H. Currently, greater excitement has focused on RNAi which uses a distinct mechanism where oligonucleotides trigger an endogenous pre-existing gene suppression pathway that is fundamental to cellular gene regulatory networks. In spite of its general success, some mRNAs are only modestly downregulated (2-fold) by RNAi and others may be refractory. Further, certain off-target effects can arise leading to unexpected consequences, underscoring the need for additional methods. The rapid rise of the RNAi field has led to an increased appreciation, of direct relevance to the present proposal, that regulatory sequence elements in mRNA 3' ends (i.e., 3'UTRs) control the expression of that gene. Here we present a progress report from a Phase 1 SBIR on the development of a new gene silencing technology which we call  U1 Adaptors,  that uses oligonucleotides annealing to specific sequence regions within the 3'UTR to inhibit pre-mRNA processing. In this Phase 2 proposal, we plan to continue the optimization work begun in Phase 1 and expand to perform high throughput analysis of U1 Adaptors to establish site selection criteria and create an algorithm and design tool to assist with application of this technology to new gene targets with ease. We further propose to test the specificity of the method using whole genome microarray analysis. We intend to focus on use of this technology in genes which appear to be difficult to suppress using RNAi methods. Finally, we propose to study use of U1 Adaptors in complex genes having more than one polyadenylation site or alternative splicing involving the terminal exon. We believe this new technology will make a significant addition to our gene silencing toolkit and may even aid emerging oligonucleotide- based therapies, although that is beyond the scope of this proposal.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The commercialization of this new U1 Adaptor mediated gene silencing technology will be a significant addition to the scientific research community's  gene silencing toolkit . Because this method exploits a distinctly different mechanism compared to more common gene silencing approaches, it has the potential of enhancing these traditional technologies when used in combination with them via additive effects. This may aid in the development of emerging oligonucleotide-based gene silencing therapies by improving sensitivity and efficacy."

Sarcopenia is one of the largest public health problems facing a rapidly increasing, aging population in the United States and leads to increased incidence of falls, fractures and associated morbidities. Previous observations from our laboratory, as well as from many other laboratories, have demonstrated the efficacy of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyrate (HMB) alone or in combination with other amino acids in enhancing muscle strength and function in young athletes. We have recently demonstrated that the combination of HMB with two other amino acids, arginine and lysine, was effective in increasing muscle mass in elderly men and women during a year-long prospective study. When analyzing the data (Preliminary Results), we demonstrated a close correlation between the levels of 25-OH Vitamin D3 in this population and the level of improvement in muscle strength. We noted that individuals with plasma 25-OH Vitamin D3 levels gt30 ng/ml manifested muscle strength gains supplemented with HMB and two amino acids, while those with plasma 25- OH Vitamin D3 of lt 30 ng/ml did not. These data form the basis of our current hypothesis that the combination of HMB and Vitamin D supplementation will be synergistic and will result in significant enhancements in overall muscle strength, function and muscle mass. We propose these Phase I and Phase II studies to prove our hypothesis. The Phase I study will test the short-term (12-wk) efficacy of a combination of HMB and Vitamin D to prevent and reverse muscle sarcopenia and the associated losses of muscular strength and functionality in older adults. We plan to recruit 100 men and women who will be assigned to one of four dietary treatments: (1) Control; (2) HMB (calcium salt), 3.0 g/day; (3) 2,000 IU Vitamin D; and (4) HMB, 3.0 g/d + 2,000 IU Vitamin D. The subjects will undergo a 3-day per week exercise program, and body composition and strength will be measured at four week intervals. We expect to demonstrate the synergy between HMB and Vitamin D in this short study. Phase II will test the long-term (12-mos) efficacy of this synergistic combination of HMB and Vitamin D on the enhancement of muscle strength and functionality in the elderly, thus leading to improved quality of life. Phase II will include an exercise arm just like Phase I, but will also include a non-exercise arm because many elderly adults do not participate in an exercise program. In addition to body composition and function and strength data, muscle biopsies will be obtained and muscle fiber and proteomic analysis will be performed. We anticipate that the data generated will lead to further research looking at mechanism(s) involved in loss of muscle and muscle function in the elderly. Improvement in muscle strength and muscle function as well as improvements in body composition over the year-long study will be used to market a product containing HMB and Vitamin D.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Current estimates place a large portion of the older U.S. populous at risk for falls with potential morbidities. A large percentage of these falls are directly related to decreased muscle strength and function. Since a significant portion of the older population is at risk of having a Vitamin D deficiency, a product that corrects such deficiencies and specifically targets muscle strength, function, and mass is likely to produce significant improvements in health, improve the quality of life, and in particular, help to decrease the incidence of falls and injury in this group. Moreover, based upon the incidence of widespread Vitamin D deficiency in all ages, we anticipate the younger population will also benefit from similar supplementation."

Disposal of these wastes, as well as recovery of water, is necessary.  However, evaporation of water also evaporates compounds with foul odors, some of which are much more volatile than water.  Even apart from a water recovery system, foul odors sap crew morale, and must be eliminated.
NanoScaleREG Corporation has developed a formulation of its proprietary sorbents, termed OdorKlenzTM, that has been shown to effectively remove odorous compounds from air by destructive adsorption.  NanoScale proposes development of a similar formulation, built around nanocrystalline metal oxides manufactured by NanoScale's proprietary procedures, such as NanoActive TiO2, NanoActive MgO, and NanoActive ZnO, to remove foul odors in a system that can recover water from wastes.  The odor control system will function during waste storage, and also during water recovery .
In Phase I, NanoScale will demonstrate feasibility by developing a formulation of metal oxides capable of removing odorous compounds from food and sanitary wastes, and compatible with a water recovery system.  Specific test compounds include skatole (3-methylindole, found in feces), putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane, in rotten protein), ammonia (urine), ethanethiol, hydrogen sulfide (rotten eggs, flatus), butyric acid (rancid butter), and butyraldehyde.  Gas streams containing these compounds will be passed through beds of the metal oxide formulation, with concentrations measured by GC, before and after passing through the bed.  In Phase II, the odor control system will be integrated into the specific details of spacecraft and envisioned lunar stations.  Then, brassboard hardware will be developed and evaluated.
NanoScale, having pioneered the synthesis and manufacture of nanocrystalline metal oxides for destructive adsorption of hazardous compounds, is uniquely qualified to perform the proposed work."

Among women with metastatic breast cancer, the 5-year survival rate is 27%. The studies proposed in this SBIR phase I application are designed to assess the feasibility of developing synthetic schweinfurthins for the treatment of breast cancer. The first schweinfurthins from a family of natural products were isolated by workers at the National Cancer Institute and showed remarkable activity against the breast, leukemia/lymphoma, renal, melanoma and CNS sub-panels of the NCI 60-cell line bioassay. The schweinfurthins appear to have a novel mechanism of action and could have broad applicability to address the significant unmet medical need of patients with breast cancer. While initially discovered during a natural products screen, the natural sources of these compounds supply only small amounts and have proven unreliable for re-isolation. Terpenoid Therapeutics and its collaborators at the University of Iowa have designed and synthesized over fifty schweinfurthin analogues, including several compounds which have low nanomolar potency against human breast cancer cell lines in vitro. The goal of this phase I feasibility application is to establish in vivo efficacy of synthetic schweinfurthins in human breast cancer xenograft models. This project will undertake the further development of synthetic schweinfurthins for the treatment of breast cancer through two specific aims: 1) Analyze synthetic schweinfurthins alone and in combination with drugs currently used in the treatment of breast cancer for in vitro growth inhibition of human breast cancer cell lines and select compounds for testing in in vivo efficacy models; and 2) Test a synthetic schweinfurthin alone and in combination with standard therapies in breast cancer xenograft models to establish in vivo efficacy. The data from these studies will support a Phase II SBIR proposal to advance a synthetic schweinfurthin into IND-enabling studies.

Over 400,000 dogs annually develop cataracts that results in vision loss and currently the only medical treatment for these dogs is cataract surgery between  3,500-6,000. We have developed an alternative, nonsurgical medical treatment that is composed of an aldose reductase inhibitor in a topical vehicle that has been trademarked as KinostatTM. In our SBIR Phase I study, we established in a masked, multicenter study composed of 40 dogs with naturally occurring DM that topical KinostatTM significantly reduces both cataract formation and the progression of cataracts in diabetic dogs. This Phase II proposal seeks to conduct studies under IAND 11-785 that are required to obtain FDA approval for KinostatTM to become commercially available. Under FDA guidance, the Phase II studies will include a 12-month masked clinical trial conducted at 5 regional clinics with dogs of various breeds with newly diagnosed DM and no cataracts present. Lens changes will be evaluated at the onset, and at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months. The efficacy of topical KinostatTM will be established by comparing the onset and severity of cataract formation in 125 dogs receiving topical KinostatTM compared to 35 dogs receiving placebo. In addition, a 6-month GLP toxicity test in 48 normal dogs of equal gender will be conducted. Both studies will utilize KinostatTM that has been synthesized, formulated and packaged under cGMP and GLP conditions by the future contract manufacturers. Bioequivalence of the manufactured product to the KinostatTM formulation in Phase I will be conducted prior to the start of the clinical trial. In addition, the manufactured formulation will be characterized for consistency of particle size and delivery amounts as mandated by the FDA. The commercial availability of KinostatTM will provide owners of an estimated 1.2 million companion dogs with DM a less costly, nonsurgical alternative medical treatment for cataracts and reduce the incidence of secondary ophthalmic complications.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks funding to obtain data required by the FDA for approval for marketing KinostatTM, a topical aldose reductase inhibitor formulation, for the prevention of cataracts in the 400,000 diabetic companion and working dogs that annually develop cataracts where vision can only be restored with costly cataract surgery. Once KinostatTM has been successfully established for the prevention of cataracts in diabetic dogs, we will repurpose this drug for humans use as an Orphan Drug for preventing aldose reductase linked cataracts in young children with diabetes. This will alleviate the need for cataract surgery in young children where proper intraocular lens placement and secondary cataracts due to posterior capsule opacification are problematic because their eyes are expected to undergo significant ocular growth after surgery."

It will use an environmentally friendly, acoustic technology that uses only clean water and silent sound. The tool will clean a wafer by simultaneously detecting and dislodging the particulates from the wafer using UPW (ultra pure water) until all particulates have been removed.  Its novelty is that this will be the first tool incorporating the endpoint determined cleaning.  It will then rinse the wafer briefly and dry it in the same tool. In this streamlined sequence, a fully clean wafer will be available for the next process step much more quickly, much more economically, and in much less cleanroom space.  Cleaning mechanism relies on constructively controlled acoustic microcavitation precisely brought about at the particle location to dislodge the particle; the cavitation implosion echo is simultaneously detected and cleaning kept track of.  This tool will be applicable to all sub-100nm technology nodes.  It will be able to detect on-wafer particulates well below 50nm.  
The broader impact/commercial potential of this project beyond semiconductor application will be in precision cleaning of lithography masks, mems, solar cells, flat panel displays, HDDs, and precision optics.  Ultimately, the principle of constructively controlled microcavitation relies on controlling the very fundamental process of phase change, the control of nucleation -- the ability to convert a liquid into a gas in the vicinity of a solid phase.  This should have much wider applications in a variety of chemical processing, e.g. in the control of the boiling processes in chemical and nuclear reactors.  The study of this acoustically mediated nucleation control could form an active field/area of research and education.  Rejected wafers amount to a colossal waste of prime resources including energy, material, and productivity time; it further amounts to environmental degradation through the effluents and scrap generated.  The use of clean tool to prevent such wafer loss directly benefits the society at large."

We have recently just achieved 510(k) FDA clearance for Pulmonary Workstation (PW 2.0) which now opens the door to the use of the Phase 2 software in the clinical arena. Our first phase II grant period, for which we seek and extension, was targeting the use of this software in the context of a clinical setting, guiding decisions and interventions associated with the placement of endobronchial valves and guiding other endobronchial interventions such as is associated with lung cancer assessment. While enthusiasm for PW2.0 remains high in interventional circles, it has also been adopted by numerous large multi-center NIH sponsored research projects as well as commercial and device company clinical trials in the US and abroad. In order to improve the workflow and to minimize human interactions, as well as to accommodate improved measures related to low lung volume scans being gathered to assess air trapping in both COPD and Asthma trials, we have established a new series of specific aims, and these new goals are directly in line with PA-08-056 seeking Phase II SBIR renewal which are associated with the building of complex instrumentation and clinical research tools to establish new biomarkers to differentiate phenotypes in a disease entity now lumped together as a single pathology. The goal of this application is to focus specifically on COPD and Asthma to complement our original emphysema focus. 1. Registration for longitudinal analysis and air trapping: we will integrate a method for accurate (1  mm or better) matching of lung volumes across time and change of lung volumes. 2. Speed up analysis for high throughput sites: The original software was designed to handle a  typical clinical load in a pulmonary bronchoscopy suite that would typically be at most 3-4 cases  per day. With the software being used to analyze up to 20,000 lung volume scans over a three  year period in just one project, we have devised a plan to introduce batch processing steps and  further develop our segmentation approaches to minimize human interventions. 3. Measurements of airway at bifurcations: Because many disease processes begin with irritant  deposition and inflammation at the airway bifurcations, VIDA proposes to measure the whole  airway tree using the optimal surface finding techniques developed for the segments in phases I  and II. 4. Improved segmentation and automatic naming of six key airway paths: COPDGene and others  have developed a phenotyping strategy for identifying and characterizing airway disease using  the scion of six specific segmental airways. VIDA herein proposes methods for reliable  automatic segmentation, naming and measurement of these smaller airways. All the newly developed tools resulting from the four aims above will be integrated into Pulmonary Workstation. Throughout the project we will continuously make updated versions of Pulmonary Workstation available to the NIH sponsored COPDGene and SPIROMICS image coordination and analysis centers for evaluation including time trials throughout years one and two. During this period user feedback will be used to further optimize the tools. A full rollout and testing of the system is planned for year three        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project defined herein is to extend VIDA Diagnostics' successful Phase II SBIR, (Tissue and Airway Assessment for Emphysema Interventions) which resulted in an FDA approved lung densitometry and airway measurement software application. Our goals are to further develop the airway and parenchymal measurements to provide more ways to phenotype subjects and more repeatable endpoints for clinical trials."

In the US for example, growers annually apply over 4,000,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer. Fertilizer rates are typically applied in excess of the crop need, since the cost of fertilizer is low relative to the loss in crop yield if a given nutrient is yield-limiting. Over-application of fertilizers can be harmful in some situations. Phosphorus increases may cause algae blooms in fresh-water ecosystems. An excess of P in the soil also can increase the risk of P runoff and leaching. Soils that are P-deficient, due to poor management or inaccurate sampling and application methods, can experience yield reductions. The economic and environmental concerns of both extremes demonstrate the importance of keeping phosphorus levels within a proper range. Phosphorus levels within a field often range from soils that are P-deficient to those are significantly above a sufficiency threshold. In order to deal with spatial variability, a large number of soil measurements must be taken on each field. Using conventional lab analyses, sampling at the scale needed for accurate mapping of phosphorus levels is not feasible. In-field measurements represent an appealing alternative. This project will develop the test equipment required to evaluate sensor technologies in a side-by-side comparison. The sensors to be used in this project have shown initial feasibility to meet the criteria. However, they have not been widely tested using unprocessed soil cores, nor has a thorough side-by-side comparison been conducted. In order to perform this feasibility comparison test, equipment will be devised to collect and process the soil cores, and bring them into contact with the sensors. Results from in-field sensors will be compared with laboratory-analyzed soil tests. The results of this Phase I project will establish a clear direction for the development of an in-field sensing system during a Phase II."

While annual usage varies based on world economic conditions, approximately 80,000,000 metric tons of fertilizer N are applied annually in the world, of which more than 10,000,000 tons are applied annually in the United States. If crops don?t have an adequate supply of nitrogen, significant yield losses can occur. Consequently, growers typically apply an extra margin of fertilizer as insurance against possible yield reduction from under-application. Excessive nitrogen applications create a number of problems. First, excess nitrogen rates can contaminate water resources. Nitrogen lost from Midwest farm fields is a leading cause of the hypoxia zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Second, wasted nitrogen can cause a significant reduction in profitability, well beyond the cost of the wasted nitrogen. On crops like potatoes and sugar beets, excess nitrogen can cause a reduction in crop quality. Third, there is a negative impact to our atmosphere from applying nitrogen that is not consumed by the crop. Unused nitrogen enters the atmosphere as a potent greenhouse gas. As US farm policy becomes increasingly based on soil and water-quality initiatives, individual farm sustainability may be affected by a farmer?s ability to maintain production levels under closer scrutiny, and even mandates on the amount of fertilizer used. For each of these factors, improvements in managing nitrogen properly will increase the sustainability of their agro-economic production systems. These improvements include accurate assessments of available nitrogen already in the soil. Current approaches employ conventional soil sampling and lab analysis. Sampling depths required for nitrate are relatively deep. As a result, nitrate sampling is laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Because the samples must be submitted to a testing lab for analysis, the delay in receiving results is a major problem for growers needing to apply fertilizer immediately. As a result of these and other obstacles, many fields that would benefit from improved nitrogen management are not sampled at all, or not sampled with the density required for accurate variable rate prescriptions. The Veris Technologies Automated Soil Measurement System will collect and analyze nitrate and other soil properties to a depth of 24? rapidly, accurately, and economically. The System will perform the measurements automatically, with no action required by the operator. Based on typical zone sampling for nitrate, this system will have a daily capacity of several hundred acres, and will be able to perform these measurements for a competitive price versus conventional sampling and lab analyses. This will offer growers major improvements in fertilizer management, reducing sampling cost, shortening turnaround time for soil test information, increasing precision of site-specific fertilizer applications."

The monitoring will eventually be accomplished by the creation of various “instrumentation modules” whose job is to examine such items as network traffic, commands being delivered by the SCADA system, and so forth. We plan on utilizing two kinds of modular constructs:  1. Software Instrumentation, named (COLLECTORs) that actively collects and reports any transitions in the operational states of the SCADA system and prevents tampering by blocking unauthorized or unexpected instruction sequences. 2. Firmware-based Behavior Monitoring modules, named (AGENTs) that continuously verifies in real-time that the operational states collected by the COLLECTOR match the expected operational profile for the monitored software application. Anomalies are reported to a central station as well as preventive steps (if known) are conveyed back to the COLLECTOR to engage in tamper-prevention steps."

This innovative Computer and Electronics Engineering Robot (CEENBoT), is a hands-on tool to teach basic to intermediate engineering skills by assembling a programmable robot. It is being developed to meet the global educational challenge by reaching thousands of US students, especially under-represented minorities and women. This platform places an engineering and educationally stimulating technology in student hands at an early age to increase interest in school and after school STEM experiences promoting advanced learning. The robot platform will allow students and commercial customers to customize software and accessories to their particular interests and applications. An adaptable hardware platform will be investigated to ensure compatibility with current and emerging technologies allowing the educational robot to be used for several years in a student's curriculum. Proposed product feasibility research will include: suitable power sources, solar power adaptability, programmable power/sleep settings, intelligent plug-and-play sensors, lightweight chassis for GPS navigation over turf and Internet connectivity for diagnostics and upgradeability. During the period of the grant a professional design team will show feasibility while advancing the technology and expanding the manufacturing base.
The CEENBoT educational platform is an outgrowth of an NSF CCLI grant to stimulate university level engineering students. Due to its success in generating enthusiasm at the university level, the platform is being introduced into grades 5-12 educational settings under two additional NSF grants: Discovery Research K-12 (cyberinfrastructure-based formal education curriculum development) and an ITEST scale up (informal educational use of the robot in 4-H clubs and summer camps). In preparation for increasing CEENBoT demand under these two grants and the further penetration into university ECE programs, the decision was made to commercialize the CEENBoT educational platform. The broader impact is the creation of a K-16 educational robotic platform for formal and non-formal educational programs (especially for inner city schools) that will provide an ongoing stimulation to increase students entering STEM fields. The proposed research will include investigation of a flexible educational robot to teach logic and programming concepts at an early age. Total US market potential for educational robots is 417,650 units annually with an $83.5 million gross revenue potential. Unit sale price is targeted at $200 with $835,000 annual revenue."

Multi-player educational video games can provide practice of high-leverage skills in an engaging virtual environment while collecting progress. Currently, US students lag behind their counterparts in other developed nations when measured on mathematics proficiency. Additionally, there are gaps in math achievement among numerous demographic groups, at least partially due to non-availability of materials and an inability to provide specialized, differentiated instruction. To close these gaps, new avenues of instruction, assessment, and progress monitoring are needed to connect with, and engage modern technologically- and socially-driven students and get them interested in practicing mathematics at a young age. Of the 53 million K-12 students in the US, 93% play video games, with multi-player gaming being the fastest growing and most engaging segment. The competitive aspects of multi-player video games, if used in classroom settings with educational content, will increase student engagement, time on task, and motivation, yielding higher math proficiency.
In light of the Response to Intervention (RtI) mandates set forth by the IDEA 2004 legislation, combined with the need for schools to utilize progress monitoring tools and research-based interventions for at-risk students, the market potential for high-quality, web-based practice/assessment applications are expanding. The product solution proposed here is unique both in theory and implementation: being grounded within adaptive-questioning assessment theory provides a more accurate measure of student performance and a more consistently challenging and engaging environment for the student, and the multi-player, computer-based implementation creates a number of benefits not currently available commercially. In our system, students will play competitively and collaboratively in a variety of multi-player games, and teachers will receive detailed reports of student progress, and be able to customize content for differentiated student groups.

Research will focus on algal growth under cool climate and low sun conditions to achieve reliable year-round production of large amounts for livestock feed in the upper Midwest.  This project seeks to investigate growing algae in raceway reactors located within green houses.  The purpose of growing the algae will be to provide animal feed.  The nutrients will come from diluted anaerobically-treated hog waste.  Heat will be provided from coal-fired boiler and flue gases will be used to provide carbon dioxide.  Flue gases will be sparged either in a tank full of feed water or through the fluid in the raceway pond itself.  The work will be carried out on a farm and the algae will be harvested using a bag system.  Harvested algae will be evaluated in a nearby university for its utility as animal feed.  Several algal strains will be evaluated.  Whole algae will be fed to animals also to test its effectiveness as feed.
The broader/commercial impact of the project will be that success in the project research could help farmers become a little less dependent on energy from fossil fuels.  If the harvested algae can be utilized as such without much treatment, it will represent an operation that can perhaps be sustained even on medium sized farms. There appears to be considerable interest in such activity from farmer groups.  The facility will also be used to educate high school students in the art of sustainable farming and train in plant operation.  Success in meeting the objectives of this SBIR project could lead to fairly rapid commercial success.  The use of aquaculture for animal feed production is anticipated to have a smaller footprint and be less energy and water intensive as opposed to terrestrial crops. The use of algae as livestock feed also carries the distinct possibility of producing meat and dairy products with a more favorable (with respect to human health) fatty acid profile."

CLINTON STREET SUITE 310,,IOWA CITY,IA,52245,JOHN SLUMP ,,(712) 490-0811,,STEPHEN MITCHELL ,,() -,,,,,,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drugs used for cancer chemotherapy tend to be highly cytotoxic and genotoxic, with well-documented carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic effects. Long-term, occupational exposure to these highly toxic drugs presents serious health risks to the healthcare personnel who routinely prepare and administer chemotherapy, such as cancers, infertility, miscarriages, birth defects, spontaneous abortions, and congenital malformations.  Leakage in the form of liquid, particulate, or vapor can occur during any of several steps in the process of compounding the drug and administering it to the patient, and several studies suggest the potential for workplace contamination is widespread. Closed system transfer devices (CSTDs) were originally developed to mitigate these risks, but the devices that are currently available in the marketplace suffer from a number of shortcomings, including leakage, needle sticks, inefficiencies, difficulty of use, and repetitive stress injuries.  The objective of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to test the feasibility of a new, innovative disposable CSTD design that has the potential to provide superior drug containment capabilities. Feasibility will be determined by pursuing two specific aims. In Aim 1, this unique concept will be refined through a series of design iterations linked to fabrication and testing of rapid prototypes, culminating in production of a proof-of concept, working prototype that can be rigorously tested to establish its performance characteristics in Aim 2. Performance of the working prototype will be validated under real-life, process simulation conditions to determine whether it can contain leakage and maintain sterility during operation under the most challenging and stressful conditions encountered during drug compounding. Containment will be measured by sensitive visual and analytical methods, and sterility will be determined using United States Pharmacopeia standards for media fill.  Successful completion of the phase I design and development studies will establish the groundwork for this novel, disposable CSTD as the cornerstone of a disruptive technology that will undergo further development in Phase II. As the population ages and the number of cancer patients grows, the demand for chemotherapy drug compounding is expected to increase, especially the preparation of tailored therapies for point-of-care use. The unique approach described in this proposal will benefit healthcare staff and patients alike by reducing the risks of occupational exposure and improving the accuracy of patient medications, while simultaneously increasing efficiencies and reducing costs. We anticipate our innovative CSTD will introduce unprecedented safety and efficiency improvements, strategically positioning JandJ to capitalize on a rapidly growing  500 million market while reducing the risks associated with compounding and administering hazardous chemotherapy drugs.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Millions of healthcare workers are at risk of exposure to hazardous drugs, such as chemotherapeutics used to treat cancer patients, during drug preparation and administration. Closed system transfer devices (CSTDs) were originally developed with the goal of protecting workers from the hazards of exposure to highly toxic drugs, but current devices have several shortcomings. This proposal describes an innovative design and approach for a new type of disposable CSTD that will provide better protection for healthcare workers and cancer patients alike, achieved by limiting the release of these hazardous drugs into the work environment."

Secondly, to increase the stability and survival rate of the organism by modifying the solution in which it is stored. Lastly, to concentrate the current dose size by improved growth rate and filtration. It is also important to evaluate the survival rate of the organim in a variety of temperatures in which it could face during transit and subsequent storage at each respective farm. Many of the solutes that will be added to the growth solution or storage solution have been shown to be protective of bacteria to high osmotic pressure and temperature changes in the environment.

Our long-term goal is to construct a multi-pathogen vaccine based on intestinal immune stimulation driven by LT as an adjuvant. The overall objective of the current proposal is to determine whether efficacious immunization against Swine Influenza (SI) can be coupled with ETEC immunization. We will produce non-infectious SI virus-like-particles and administer them along with LT and K88 in a vaccine and subsequently test for protection against the same subtype of SI virus and against ETEC. In future studies, immunization protocols will be optimized, and an assessment will be made of influenza virus strain cross protection.

Even once a process for making a carbohydrate has been developed, manufacture of that molecule in all the variants that biologists demand for their studies to drive glycomics remains labor and material intensive. The lack of ready access to a range of carbohydrate structures, given the extreme difficulty in isolating sufficient and pure quantities from natural sources, has been a severe limitation to advancing not only the science but also the resulting carbohydrate based vaccines and diagnostics built on this basic understanding. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to develop the commercial custom synthesis of oligosaccharides using stable and, if possible, crystalline building blocks in association with an innovative new automated solution-phase process for building block assembly. This phase I proposal addresses roadblocks that stand in the way of the development of this process at this stage. The specific aims are 1) the preparation of a range of N-phenyl substituted trifluoroacetimidoyl halides as glycosyl activating reagents; 2) the preparation of different trifluoroacetimidoyl based glycosyl donors with tests of their stability and reactivity; and 3) the reaction of these donors with a range of glycosyl acceptors to form disaccharide libraries in a solution-phase-based automation strategy amenable to iterative oligosaccharide synthesis. At the conclusion of these studies, stable glycosyl donors reactive with a wide range of glycosyl acceptors in a solution phase automation platform will have been discovered to pave the way for a standardized set of carbohydrate building blocks for on-demand custom-order oligosaccharide synthesis.

A number of paint products on the market claim  antimicrobial  functions. However, the current products have significant shortfalls, including weak antimicrobial activities, risk of microbial resistance, and difficulty in monitoring and extending the antimicrobial functions once the paints are applied. To solve these problems, in this proposed project, we will use polymeric N-halamines, a class of widely used water and food disinfectants, as antimicrobial additives to provide biocidal effects against bacteria (including drug-resistant species), mold and other fungi species, viruses, and spores. An N-halamine is a compound containing one or more nitrogen-halogen covalent bonds. N-halamines have similar antimicrobial efficacy as hypochlorite bleach, but they are much more stable, none corrosive, with no reported cases of microbial resistance, and have a much less tendency to generate halogenated hydrocarbons. In our technology, a new N-halamine monomer developed in our lab, N-chloro-2,2,6,6- tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl acrylate (Cl-TMPA), will be polymerized to produce polymeric N-halamine latex emulsions. On adding a small amount of such emulsions into conventional water-based latex paint, the new paint will be able to provide potent antimicrobial activities against various microorganisms. The antimicrobial activity is anticipated to last for the lifetime of the paint under normal use. Challenging conditions (e.g., heavy soil, flooding, etc.) may consume more chlorine and thus shorten the antimicrobial duration. Nevertheless, the antimicrobial function of the new paints can be easily monitored by a simple potassium iodine/starch test. That is, polymeric N-halmines will react with potassium iodine to generate a dark blue color with starch. Thus, this test determines whether the paint still provides antimicrobial functions. If it shows that the antimicrobial function is lost, the polymeric N-halamine structures can be resumed by wiping the surface with diluted hypochlorite bleach to recharge the lost chlorine and regenerate the antimicrobial functions. The recharging can be repeated as needed. If successful, this technology will provide an innovative approach to protect high-touch, high-risk surfaces in a wide range of applications, which will have a broad and significant impact on health. This STTR Phase I study is designed to establish the feasibility and effectiveness of the new approach before continuation and expansion of the project. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) create polymeric N-halamine latex emulsions; (2) mix the polymeric N-halamine latex emulsions with commercially important latex paints, and characterize the physical properties, antimicrobial performance, and biocompatibility of the new paints developed; and (3) preliminarily determine the cost of the new approach.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The unique features of the new paints include the broad antimicrobial spectrum against bacteria, mold and other fungi species, viruses, and spores, the ease in monitoring the antimicrobial activity, the rechargability of N-halamines if the antimicrobial function is accidentally lost, and the low risk of microbial resistance. These advantages make the new polymeric N-halamine-based antimicrobial paints an attractive candidate for protecting high-touch, high-risk surfaces in residential, commercial, institutional, industrial, and other related facilities. This STTR Phase I research will serve as the foundation for continuation and expansion of the project and finally commercialize the products to improve the microbial quality of a wide range of environmental surfaces, and this will have a broad and significant impact on health."

Processes such as stretch forming are typically used to produce these parts, in which unique dies are required for each forming operation.  This increases the cost and lead time of production.  The need for dies prevents the production of spares at the maintenance site and the need to store, maintain, locate, setup, and dismantle these dies contributes significantly to the cost of producing spare parts.  A revolutionary, patent-pending, discrete parts stretch forming technology uses “universal dies” to eliminate specialized tooling.  With computer numerical controls, one machine can be programmed to manufacture a range of extrusions, such as former rings and stringers, that are traditionally stretch formed starting with metal extrusions.  Computer simulations of one such machine have demonstrated the feasibility of this process to produce formed parts with stress residuals and geometric accuracy comparable to that achieved by stretch forming.  Additionally, the simulations have shown that the parts produced by this process would be of superior quality and durability."

The goal is a system to perform comprehensive pattern analysis of state-of-the-art biochemical separations generated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). A critical challenge for elective utilization of GCxGC-HRMS for biochemical classification and biomarker discovery is the diffculty of analyzing and interpreting the massive, complex data for metabolomic and proteomic features. The quantity and complexity of the data, as well as the large dimensionality of the biochemistry in which significant characteristics may be subtle and involve patterns of variations in multiple constituents, necessitate the investigation and development of new bioinformatics. The principal technical objective is an innovative framework for comprehensive feature matching and analysis across many samples. Feature matching is the basis for uniformly labeling structures so that similarities and differences can be documented.  Specifically, the framework will incorporate advanced methods for multidimensional peak detection, peak pattern matching across large sample sets, data alignment, GCxGC-HRMS feature computations, and classification with large feature sets. The anticipated result is the technical foundation for a commercial system to classify biological samples and identify significant biomarkers.
The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be a better understanding of biochemical processes and discovery of metabolomic and proteomic biomarkers, leading to improved methods for disease diagnoses and treatments. These innovative bioinformatics will contribute to economic competitiveness in the global market for analytical technologies and will foster utilization of advanced GCxGC-HRMS instrumentation. The informatics developed in this project also will be relevant for other classification problems involving multidimensional, multispectral data, including other applications (such as biofuels),other types of chemical analyses (such as multidimensional spectroscopy), and other fields (such as remote-sensing multispectral geospatial imagers).  The project will contribute to workforce development, by involving student interns in research experiences through internships and project sponsorships, and to education, by providing software and example data to allow students to more easily explore biochemical complexity."

Often, it is impossible to manually search through the data that can come out of these simulations, which may range from Gigabytes to Terabytes. Furthermore, it may be impossible to visualize the multi-dimensional interactions that are occurring in the data. A tool is needed that will concurrently data-mine the vast data sets that are produced and alert the scientist of significant events (either planned or unplanned). 21st Century Systems, Incorporated and Brigham Young University introduce our Concurrent Agent-enabled Feature Extraction (CAFÉ) concept to answer this challenge. CAFÉ features state-of-the-art data-mining and analysis leveraging BYU’s expertise. An innovative intelligent agent structure from 21CSI will allow concurrent data-mining utilizing information sharing that will make it possible for multiple analysis methods to work together to improve the data-mining performance. The agent design, specifically the evidential inference engine, also allows direct collaboration with the data-mining algorithms by the scientist. In this way, CAFÉ allows the scientist to observe and correct the data-mining of high-fidelity fluid dynamic simulations maximizing valuable research time.   BENEFIT:   Searching for physics-related events in complex large scale simulations will be enhanced by a tool that extracts and displays accurate, near real-time patterns from massively large data sets.  With CAFÉ, the potential exists to go even further through the interaction of concurrent, on-the-fly, queries and responses among the CAFÉ agents as well as with the human operator within a single social network.  During Phase I, with the approval of the AFOSR TPOC, 21CSI will contact the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Information Directorate at Rome Labs to acquire end user requirements for CAFÉ.  The 21CSI team fully intends to build and transition key technological elements such as the collaborative agent concept and information inferencing products using the collaborative environment derived from 21CSI’s Evidential Reasoning NetworkTM (ERN) technology – to suitable USAF and DoD development centers for concurrent data mining. Furthermore, military command & control (C2) operations involved with blast and fragmentation effects in urban areas will benefit from this technology. Urban combat damage to structures could inhibit troop movements or induce sniper stands.  The Battle Command Battle Lab - Ft. Huachuca is interested in the technology for a new training simulator for artillery planners and commanders.  CAFÉ will expand the capabilities already developed for Ft. Huachuca by allowing us better insight into blast events and produce a more accurate simulation. The team of 21CSI and BYU will pursue further development of CAFÉ with proposals to General Electric Aircraft Engines.  Currently, it costs more than $2 billion and 10 years to develop a new aircraft engine.  BYU’s vision is to create a world-class virtual simulation of an entire jet engine to allow repetition in the process to be done virtually at a lower cost and shorter time. With the addition of CAFÉ the experimentalist can perform concurrent efforts saving simulation time and data storage costs.  Together, this would help to uncover problems before a significant investment is made in building a physical jet engine model. While physical testing can never be eliminated, it can be reduced from current set of 12 versions of development engines – a costly and time-consuming process. Another U.S. government, but non-DoD, area of active interest is modeling to stop terrorist activity here at home.  At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), the Nonproliferation, Homeland and International Security (NHI) directorate aims to be the premier provider of systems solutions to preclude WMD proliferation from terrorist attack.  LLNL will partner with research institutions and industry to transition new capabilities to operational use.  Mitigating the consequences of potential effluent plumes from a released WMD that a terrorist might want to use at a large public gathering coupled with [un]favorable weather might be desirable to the evil-doers.  Countermeasures include modeling the combination of potential plumes and weather forecasts to provide best use of civilian law enforcement and US government personnel."

Focusing on these areas will allow more effective communication and a better understanding of the information. The team of 21st Century Systems, Incorporated and Wright State University are excited to apply our expertise and experience for this effort we call, C2-Tool for Actionable Information Display (CoolAID). CoolAID will leverage our considerable experience in situational awareness tools, melded with research related to visualizations and humans in complex systems through WSU. The prototype CoolAID framework will be created with multi-modal display technologies as well as Bayesian and evidential reasoning for data analysis. The developmental process will help isolate what makes information actionable within the sample domain and provide a variety of information presentation techniques which can be used in concert. Phase I concludes with development of a testing plan which will measure the effectiveness of multi-modal information presentation."

This next-generation system should provide high-level capabilities for managing case files containing evidence, expert opinions, and data relationships. The system should enhance operator awareness by highlighting salient aspects of the case file, critical relationships, and confidence assessments. Pedigree management is important for confidence assessment, but the system must also provide mechanisms to help see beyond the pedigree horizon. The system must be able to combine human and machine-generated information in an intuitive, collaborative, and operator-tunable manner. 21st Century Systems Incorporated proposes to apply its expertise in developing Intelligence-based Decision Support Systems to the challenge of creating the next generation Space Control decision support system. Many of the core challenges have been addressed in our Webster-ACE (Agent Case Expert) project, but there is significant work required to adapt it for the needs of Space Control operations. In this proposal, we provide an introduction to salient aspects of the Webster-ACE technology and present a work plan for undertaking the innovative work required to adapt these aspects for Space Control operations. The name of our concept is the Agent Case Expert for Space Control Decision Support or Space-ACE.  BENEFIT: In support of the JFCC, the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) requires advanced operator-tunable data association and filtering techniques to identify pertinent, high-valued, actionable information in support of Space Situation Awareness extracted from incoming data streams and cyber chat. With Space-ACE, the potential exists to identify serious threats to spacecraft in order to prevent adverse actions before they happen. Assessments generated by Space-ACE will provide JSpOC, USSTRATCOM, and Combatant Commanders the necessary information for Space Control operations for the Space Command & Control (C2) Weapons System and through NECC networks via web-services access to the algorithms. 21CSI fully intends to build and transition key technological elements  the collaborative agent concept, information inferencing products using the collaborative environment derived from 21CSIs Evidential Reasoning Network (ERN) technology to suitable USAF and DoD development centers for concurrent data mining. The commercial transition is similar to the military transition. The target customer list is somewhat narrow, but very important in terms of overall capabilities and revenue generation. Commercial satellite services revenue grew at an impressive rate from $86.9 billion in 2005 to $111.1 billion in 2006, while commercial space infrastructure revenue was up from $28.7 billion in 2005 to $33.1 billion in 2006. Commercial satellite services represent the dominant space sector accounting for 50 percent of space economic activities. Direct-to-home television services were up 20 percent to $55 billion in 2006. The commercial space industry is enormous and is totally dependent on a relatively small number of on orbit vehicles essentially low density, high demand assets. The $55 billion direct-to-home television service in the U. S. currently has 18 on-orbit satellites. In this high risk business a single satellite on orbit represents an investment in excess of $300 million.  In commercial space, just as in military space, you cant protect what you cant see. The U. S. commercial space industry, as well as the U. S. military, currently has a very difficult time seeing into space and understanding what is happening to critical on orbit assets. Sensors and systems are in development to provide information about what is happening in space. Space-ACE will provide more rapid and effective fusion and overall understanding of the picture in space improved space situational awareness. More rapid and effective understanding means more rapid and effective response in situations that could potentially result in the loss or destruction of critical space resources."

This system should prepare a Weapons Handling Plan using as much autonomy as the Weapons Department personnel are comfortable with, from collaborative software aid to near complete autonomy. 21st Century Systems, Incorporated is pleased to introduce OHMAS, “Ordnance Handling MultiAgent System.” OHMAS’s heart is the Interactive Weapons Handling Plan (IWHP), which can be thought of as equal parts of spreadsheet, map, application menu, and weapons handling scheduler and planner. The IWHP utilizes leading edge technologies and is accessible as a web service. The IWHP collaborates with other Virtual Ordnance Handling Agents (VOHA) in order to construct a weapons handling plan. Each VOHA contains a knowledge model which encapsulates the decision processes of an Ordnance Handling Officer as he constructs and executes a Weapons Handling Plan. The optimal weapon routes through the ship are determined by an innovative space-time path finding algorithm, which handles several weapons simultaneously. And with a 100th percentile commercialization rating, we are just the company to deliver this capability to the warfighter."

Higher quality video would alleviate much of the challenge for the operator, increasing the likelihood that they will detect and identify targets and increase their confidence in the presence and type of targets.  In addition, improving the quality of video would increase the autonomous detection and tracking capabilities that support the operators ability to interpret the images and make timely decisions. 21st Century Systems, Incorporated is excited to apply our extensive video analytics expertise to develop Video20/20, an innovative real-time EO/IR video-enhancement toolset.   Video20/20 is a set of software tools that provide in real-time haze-free, stabilized video with higher resolution and contrast enhancement making it easier to detect and distinguish enemy activities in EO/IR video collected from UAV platforms.  The software tools will be designed for improving the image quality of UAV EO/IR video for both human interpretation and to improve autonomous detection and tracking capabilities.     BENEFIT: There is an immediate need for this video enhancement capability in all branches of the DoD. Unmanned Systems technology has been revolutionized during the current OIF and OEF conflicts, and we can expect to see even more of them in future conflicts. UAVs have performed thousands of ISR missions (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) in support of ongoing operations. They have greatly expanded the level of real-time intelligence available to the warfighter.  Despite the many recent advances in Unmanned Systems technology, there are many technical challenges yet to overcome. The limitation of the value of any ISR platform is the ability of a human operator to interpret actionable intelligence from the video stream. Soldiers, Airmen, and Image Analysts are currently hampered by video that is often low-quality and difficult to interpret. By developing a tool that can improve image quality, we can greatly improve the tactical value of every Micro and Small UAV in service.  Our system will enable a next-generation capability for UAV operation. It will allow an operator to interpret data from a single UAV much more easily, with less fatigue and eyestrain, and provide greater situational awareness than existing systems. It will also allow the same operator to more easily monitor multiple UAV video streams and be able to interpret and act on them with minimal effort. By cleaning up the imagery, the operator will be able to maintain a much greater understanding of the ground situation with less effort on their part."

Most vision screening is conducted on children once they have started kindergarten; this is after the critical detection period for the treatment of amblyopia. Early detection is essential for favorable prognosis. Unfortunately less than 21% of pre-kindergarten children receive any sort of vision screening. National Genecular Institute Holdings, Inc. (NGIh) has built and begun testing and optimization of a digital photorefractor that can be used to screen preverbal and preliterate children for amblyogenic risk factors. NGIh's technology will streamline the screening process and reduce the overall time and cost of vision screening. The NGIh Digital Photorefractor (DPR) will offer all screening programs a device with a high specificity and sensitivity. Specifically this Phase I study aims to: 1) Optimize the parameter of flash width, 2) Optimize the parameter of exposure time and image interval, and 3) Optimize DPR performance by testing additional flash eccentricities. Results from this study will provide the necessary data for the design of the optimized DPR test product for clinical evaluation in Phase II. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: National Genecular Institute Holdings, Inc. (NGIh) is developing a digital photorefractor (DPR) to assist in the screening of preliterate and preverbal children for amblyopia (lazy eye). This system images the corneal light reflex, bright crescents, and the Bruckner reflex to screen children for amblyogenic risk factors.

Presently, continuous monitoring is unavailable and this process is controlled using time consuming and labor intensive off-line analyses. This sensing technology uses near infrared absorption spectra of bioreactor growth medium collected continuously to monitor analyte concentrations and changes in biomass throughout the fermentation process. Preliminary results demonstrate the ability to make accurate and continuous analytical measurements and to actively control metabolite concentrations. This success is attributed to ASL innovations that include using a solid-state spectrometer, restricting the measurement spectral range, and implementing a calibration strategy based on analyte-specific chemical information. This Phase I effort will establish the commercial feasibility of this monitoring approach by developing a robust, practical calibration system for routine operation and by designing a means to continuously and non-destructively collect analytical spectra.  The broader impacts of this research will be to enable accurate feedback control of bioreactors, thereby enhancing optimization
efforts and maximizing production yields of high commodity proteins. Successful development of a continuous, real-time monitor for Pichia pastoris will enhance its attractiveness as a protein expression platform. The proposed monitor will overcome the limitations of off-line analyses by providing an effective means to follow metabolite concentrations and cell density changes non-destructively during the course of a fermentation process. This sensing technology will fill a void in the general protein expression market where reliable, on-line sensing is unavailable.

Childhood weight and behavior are significant predictors of adult overweight and obesity (Whitaker, 1997; Dietz & Gortmaker, 2001; ACS, 2004). While programs that attempt to address weight issues continue to be developed, the problem continues to grow (CDC, 2006). Changing the behaviors that lead to overweight and obesity is known to be a complex and difficult undertaking. We believe that the game we are proposing can contribute a piece to the puzzle. We are proposing a video game because it will appeal to children. Whether they have any interest or previous awareness of issues related to their weight, they will be attracted to play the game purely because it provides an engaging and entertaining video game experience (NPD, 2005). We are targeting awareness and self-efficacy because they are precursors to behavior change. Awareness is involved in the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) concepts of behavioral capability and expectations (Bandura, 1998). In the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), awareness relates to consciousness raising, a key process of change (Prochaska, 1992). Self-efficacy is a central construct in SCT and TTM and has been shown to be a strong predictor of physical activity and food-related behavior (Bernier & Avard, 1986; Kelder, Perry, & Klepp, 1993; Marcus, Eaton, Rossi, & Harlow, 1994; Sallis, Prochaska, & Taylor, 2000). By increasing awareness and self-efficacy, our game will provide an easy and inexpensive approach to prepare children for programs that are already in place or being developed for community organizations, such as 4-H, YMCA, YWCA, scouts, church youth programs, ethnic support centers, and government health promotion programs. The game will align with National Health Education Standards and will complement upper elementary school health curriculum, as well as good parenting practices. Children will eagerly play the game because it is entertaining. It will be easy to use and requires no special training or preparation for program leaders, teachers, or parents. The game will be developed to run on computer systems readily available for use in community programs, schools, and in homes."

The objective of this application is to identify at least one set of conditions in which the act of drying drugs by the scCO2 process known as lyophobic precipitation (LP) can also sterilize the drug product in its dispensing container as well as the chamber in which the process is conducted. The rationale behind this project is that recent observations that scCO2 can be used to effect terminal sterilization of food and medical products without damaging the product will be adaptable to the LP drying process. Many drugs, including many anticancer agents, must be administered by non-oral routes (intravenous or intraperitoneal) and therefore must be sterile for injection. For stability reasons such drugs often must be dry as well as sterile. Current technology requires a two-step process of filter-sterilization followed by lyophilization under aseptic conditions to achieve safe, stable dosage forms. To accomplish the objectives of this application two specific aims will be pursued: (1) determine the level of sterilization of drug substance and container under normal LP conditions and using tested and untested added sterilizing agents, and (2) determine the level of sterilization of the chamber under normal LP conditions and using tested and untested added sterilizing agents. The strategy to accomplish the specific aims is to measure the level of killing of standard sterility-testing biological indicators added to containers of model drug under conditions that mimic the conditions that will eventually be used commercially. Similarly, challenge doses of biological indicators will be placed in the LP chamber to determine effectiveness of sterilization of the process with and without added sterilizing agents. The expectation is that at the conclusion of this Phase I SBIR period of support, precise conditions necessary to achieve a sterilization activity level of 10-6 for drug substance contained in a dispensing container and the chamber in which the lyophobic precipitation occurs will be identified. This information will guide a Phase II application to determine the effect of treatment conditions determined in this study on the chemical stability of existing oncology drugs that possess various reactive groups (e.g., alcohols, amines, thiols, carboxylic acids, etc.) that may prove susceptible to damage. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes a new technique to safely dry and terminally sterilize drugs in their dispensing containers. If successful, this approach will lead to simpler processing of injectable drugs that would increase safety and lower production costs."

ANDREWS DRIVE,SUITE 210,LAWRENCE,KS,66047,MIKE SMITHYMAN ,,(785) 215-0932,,KIMBERLY HOLT ,,() -,,,,,,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic headache represent one of the most common and disabling medical conditions affecting adolescents, with a sizeable proportion of those affected continuing to have significant impairment into their adult years. Many of these children must exclusively rely on suboptimal medical treatments that in some cases can worsen headache conditions due to limited access to other forms of effective treatment. Cognitive-behavioral treatment for headache has demonstrated efficacy yet is available to only a small fraction of those adolescents who may most benefit. The goal of the proposed research program is to develop, test, and ultimately disseminate an internet-based cognitive-behavioral headache management product capable of becoming part of the standard of care for effectively treating primary headache disorders in adolescent patients. Research during the initial phase will determine the likely commercial viability of the proposed product through evaluating the scientific validity of the product content, the likelihood of physicians to recommend the product to patients and colleagues, the receptiveness of intended product users to the product content and design, and the technical feasibility of using an internet-based format for treating adolescents with chronic headaches. Core program content and design features will be iteratively refined during this initial research based on survey and focus group feedback from headache specialists and from the intended users of the program (children aged 13-18 with a primary headache disorder and their parents/caregivers). Approximately 100 healthcare providers specializing in headache management will receive descriptions of the program content and design and complete surveys inquiring about clinical relevance, scientific validity, utility in clinical practice, and likelihood of recommending this type of product to patients and colleagues. Following modifications to the program based on provider feedback, child and parent/caregiver focus groups comprising 16 participants in total (8 children with primary headache disorders and 8 parent/caregivers) will be recruited from neurology clinics at a large freestanding pediatric hospital. Focus group participants will be shown descriptions and sample images of the proposed program and asked to comment in detail through verbal discussion and structured surveys on the appropriateness, attractiveness, appeal, and perceived utility of the content and design. Subsequently, two child and two caregiver sample lessons will be developed by computer programmers taking into account the focus group and healthcare provider feedback. Sample lessons will be programmed using Macromedia Flash software and will contain audio, video, animation, and interactivity tailored to the given user based on an integrated on-line daily headache tracking system. Focus group participants will be re-contacted to complete the sample lessons on home computers and will be asked to provide additional feedback on appeal and technical feasibility through structured on-line surveys. Resulting data will be summarized with descriptive statistics and analyzed to determine whether proceeding forward with further research and development efforts in this area appears justified. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic headache disorders affect a substantial and rising number of teenagers and represent a significant public health concern given the level of disability and impairment they often cause throughout adolescence and into adult life. The proposed research and development efforts have the capacity to effectively address this significant public health concern through using an easily accessible format (the internet) to equip the millions of adolescents who have disabling chronic headaches with scientifically sound and clinically effective headache self-management strategies."

The foci of the four programs will be (1) basic paragraph-writing skills, (2) advanced paragraph-writing skills, (3) basic essay-writing skills, and (4) advanced essay-writing skills. The lessons within each program will include an introduction to the program and the targeted writing skills, a description of how to use a targeted writing strategy, demonstrations, practice activities, and feedback. The Phase I project will focus on the feasibility of this medium for teaching complex writing skills to struggling writers. Measures will focus on (a) student use of the program, (b) student knowledge of writing skills, (c) student writing skills related to writing topic, detail, and concluding sentences within a paragraph, and (d) student satisfaction. During Phase I, an informal and a formal pilot test will be conducted to determine the feasibility of the prototype program. During each of the three years of Phase II, at least one informal pilot test and one field test of one new program will be conducted. A pretest-posttest control-group design with random assignment of students to groups will be utilized in each field test to determine the effects of each instructional program on student knowledge, performance, and generalization of the writing skills to complete writing tasks. The programs resulting from this project, because they will be designed to include instructional methods that have been found to be successful with at-risk students, should enable these students to respond successfully to the writing demands of their courses and minimum competency tests. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to public health because the number of individuals with low literacy skills is substantial. Low literacy has been associated with dropping out of school and such poor adult outcomes as under-employment and unemployment, criminal activity, and poverty (van Der Veen and Preece, 2005). Moreover, individuals who drop out of school have more mental and physical health problems than individuals who complete high school (Carter, 1998). Students who are at-risk for dropping out of school often have writing skill deficits. Only about half of their sentences are complete sentences. They do not know how to organize and write basic paragraphs and essays, and they are not able to respond to the writing demands of their required courses. A large number of these students will either drop out of school or continue to struggle with writing tasks throughout their school careers and into adulthood. The empirically validated IM products that will result from this project will address the potentially devastating effects that low literacy can cause in children's lives and in society at large. Indeed, about a third of all students and half of all blacks, Latinos, and American Indians are currently failing to graduate from high school on time (Freudenberg and Ruglis, 2007). Since writing skills are needed for success in secondary and post-secondary educational settings and work settings, this project has the potential to help many individuals to succeed and have a better prospect for mental health. The instruction would be used to help struggling writers learn to create a variety of paragraphs and essays. The instructional programs that will result from this project will be usable as literacy intervention programs based on individual needs. In addition, the proposed programs will serve as a model for the development of future IM programs."

Low-weight, high-inertia flywheel technology can significantly assist the diesel engine duty cycle such that more production can be had with the same amount of diesel fuel consumed. This will in effect lower the cost of grinding woody resources as measured by cost per ton. Each year in the United States alone, an estimated 157 millions of gallons of diesel fuel are consumed in the processing of recovering woody waste streams. The woody waste streams have value in the forms of renewable energy source for electricity co-generation, potential feed stock for cellulose ethanol, engineered wood products such as particle board and press-forms, compost, landscape mulch, and other soil amendments. The USDA estimates that only 5% of the total available woody resources in the United States are currently being utilized. It is expected that recovering woody resources will grow as a source of green, renewable, carbon neutral energy source in the future and hence the need to lower the cost of processing.  The drive to conserve energy and reduce the United States
dependence on foreign oil will require a national effort on many different fronts, with each small efficiency gain contributing to that overall goal. The Phase 1 supporting research for this Phase 2 project indicates that a theoretical efficiency gain of 20% is possible with this technology. This Phase 2 project will reduce the diesel fuel consumption and hence total cost of the processing of woody biomass into useful forms. Developing this flywheel technology will make the woody waste stream more viable for energy generation including electricity and cellulose derived ethanol feedstock, reduce the nation's diesel fuel consumption, and it will make the companies involved in grinding woody wastes more profitable and productive. In addition to the impact this technology will have on recovering woody biomass, there are other markets where intermittent diesel engine duty cycles can benefit from developing high inertia flywheel technology. Concrete recycling, rock crushing, automobile shredding, and scrap tire recycling are market examples that can also benefit from adding low-weight, high-inertia flywheel technology to those equipment drive trains. It is expected that the technology developed and commercialized in this project will be applied towards those other markets."

The hypothesis is that it is possible to predict the tenderness of beef using only a moderate number of bands for the image. This is based on the observation that hyperspectral images contain large amounts of redundant information. The technological challenge is to verify the hypothesis by identifying the key bands that are central to tenderness prediction and to develop a model to accurately predict tenderness. Identification of key bands will be performed using data mining and image analysis algorithms. Successful verification of the hypothesis will directly lead to the development of a multispectral system for tenderness prediction at commercial speeds.  Currently there are limited methods for real time classification of beef by tenderness, the most important trait influencing consumer satisfaction. Meat packers have expressed a desire to sort by tenderness, because consumers are willing to pay a premium for steaks that are guaranteed tender (an added value of $170 to $421 per carcass certified as tender). Some of the major packers have expressed interest in a service to classify beef for tenderness. At 2.5% of value added per head for 20% of the cattle, annual revenue of $23.7 million to $58.7 million could be generated from service sales to the top four U.S. meat packers. International potential would magnify this effect. This project, if successful, is expected to enhance economic opportunities for cattle producers and processors by improving assessment of beef product quality to meet consumer expectations.

There is a need for new vaccines for PRRSV to battle the strain evolution and heterogeneity of this RNA virus. Currently the only available US commercial product is a Modified Live Virus (MLV) from BI-Vetmedica. Use of a MLV PRRSV vaccine poses the risks of reversion to virulence and recombination with field viruses and thus is not compatible with an eradication program. Traditional killed autogenous vaccines for PRRSV are also available but are slow to produce / prepare (up to 3 months) and because they contain the whole virus they are not compatible with differential diagnostic tests. In a recent meeting at the University of Illinois attended by renowed scientists and chaired/organized by Dan Rock a white paper was produced which concluded that MLV and inactivated whole virus vaccines were not efficaciouis under field conditions. Unfortunately, Live Virulent Virus Inoculation (LVI) has been thought of as a last resort which leads to dramatic losses of animals and profits of an affected farm. As a result a number of requirements were presented in the white paper for the identification of an effective vaccine; 1 ? Rapid induction of immunity 2 ? Cross-protection against most currently prevalent strains 3 ? No adverse outcomes to swine health 4 ? DIVA (Differentiate Infected from Vaccinated Animals) 5 ? Simplicity of administration to ensure compliance. Based on these set criteria we believe that PRRS-RP technology not only has a potential significant advantage over traditional vaccines but also meets each of these requirements as a new effective PRRS vaccine. The objective of the proposal is to show the PRRS-RP vaccine candidate is not only able to significantly reduce viremia but is safe and efficacious. We aim to accomplish this by; determining if vaccinated pigs shed PRRS-RP and if so do non-vaccinated co-mingled pigs become infected. In response to this data we will determine if a non-target species is capable of shedding the PRRS-RP and if so can it infect other comingled animals. To aid in potency testing we aim to build on the current potency assay (IFA based) by developing a qPCR assay to quantify genome number (total particles / total genomes) giving a reproducible measure of complete PRRS-RP per dose hence aid in the determination of an effective dose. To determine the PRRS-RP product safety profile a study will be performed. These studies will position Harrisvaccines, Inc. to effectively pursue a USDA licensed product, to combat and alleviate the effects of PRRSV on the swine industry. In addition, this newly licensed product will not induce antibodies currently detected in the standard ELISA diagnostic test for PRRSV (DIVA) which will be essential in a national eradiction program, as endorsed by the AASV and producers."

Our new interior reconstruction theory assumes exact knowledge on a small subregion in the region of interest, such as air in the lungs, blood in the heart, etc. As a surprising result, exact and stable interior reconstruction becomes feasible  This break though has numerous biomedical implications, and will benefit or enable a wide range of CT applications including lung CT, cardiac CT, temporal bone imaging, intraoperative CT and so on, where we need to handle large objects, minimize radiation dose, suppress scattering artifacts, enhance temporal resolution, reduce system cost, and increase scanner throughput. The overall goal of this project is to develop both analytic and iterative reconstruction algorithms and software for interior tomography. The specific aims are to (1) develop analytic and theoretically exact interior reconstruction algorithms that have not been possible before; (2) develop efficient iterative interior reconstruction algorithms that incorporate additional constraints to improve image quality and reduce radiation dose further; and (3) evaluate the proposed interior reconstruction algorithms in numerical simulation and phantom experiments and develop the first of its kind software package for interior tomography. On completion of this project, we will have developed both analytic and iterative exact interior reconstruction algorithms for preclinical and clinical CT applications, and develop a commercial software package ready to be competitive on the marketplace.

This is especially true for the vulnerable populations of individuals with psychiatric disorders. This SBIR Phase I application will develop a prototype for recruitment enhancement with a novel internet- based system which will proactively engage patients and their caregivers who desire to be informed about clinical trials which might be relevant for their specific diagnoses, disease states and various other characteristics which might determine their likelihood of meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria for specific studies. The system will be frequently updated and contain an active educational component for providing recruits with information about the nature of clinical trials and provide a well-characterized, well-informed recruitment population which will enhance the informed consent population. The prototype will focus on the development of systems for recruitment of schizophrenics and patients with major depressive disorder with the goal of expanding this system to other major psychiatric disorders in Phase II. Prototype development will involve development of a novel website interface in association with an intelligent database design. Information obtained from focus groups composed of patients, clinical research professionals, computer science professionals and ethicists will help guide and refine the design of the system. Mock recruitment studies will also test performance parameters of the system. Development will maintain focus on features which will be marketable pharmaceutical firms, contract research organizations and clinical trial sites. Such features will speed the recruitment process, enhance retention and also aid in protocol development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Psychiatric Disorders, such as Generalized Anxiety Disorder, cause great disability worldwide. This project will attempt to develop a computer and internet-based system for significantly improving the recruitment of patients who are the most appropriate for studies designed to develop better medications for treating these illnesses."

Yet, such an analyzer is required to support the widespread deployment needed to achieve a better understanding of the global methane budget and to quantify exchanges between the atmosphere and terrestrial biosphere.  Building on an open-path methane analyzer developed previously, this project will develop a tunable diode laser-based closed-path CH4 and H2O gas analyzer.  The new closed-path instrument will use newly-developed laser technology:  vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL) and wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS).  Compared to cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), VCSEL and WMS will provide better spectral performance (especially at ambient pressure), lower power consumption, high sensitivity, and less susceptibility to mirror contamination.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of developing a closed-path CH4 and H2O gas analyzer with VCSEL and WMS.  The resolution of this analyzer was better than 2 ppb CH4·(Hz)-1/2, which exceeded the required specification for methane flux measurement.  Phase II will (1) develop a closed-path CH4 and H2O gas analyzer prototype, using a VCSEL, a dense-pattern multi-pass optical cell, and WMS; and (2) develop the instrument-embedded and application software.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  Available methane analysis methods, such as gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy,  are not suitable for long-term continuous field measurement, and laser-based CRDS requires main power, ultraclean optics, and isolation from the environment.  The proposed analyzer could be used for net ecosystem methane exchange measurement.  It also could be used for year-round measurements of atmospheric methane concentration, with minimum maintenance and with power from solar panels and batteries."

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on synthesis and delivery of nanoparticles for determination of the progression of cancer. Besides diagnosis, the nanoplatform offers the treatment option of directing high- temperature therapy specifically to the tumor, without harming healthy tissue. The nanoplatform contains a central iron/iron oxide/gold core/shell nanoparticle, plus the ability to identify which of four cancer-specific enzymes in the patient?s body are abnormally active. The activity of these four enzymes indicates the progression of cancer (Stage I, Stage II, Stage III, or Stage IV).  The broader impacts of this research are earlier diagnosis of cancer, and more effective treatment of cancer. Cancer is the second largest cause of death in developed countries, accounting for nearly 20% of all deaths. Early detection of cancer is essential even before
anatomic anomalies are visible. A major challenge in cancer diagnosis is detection of tumors at an early stage for maximum therapeutic benefit. An example is breast cancer where mammography requires more than a million cells for accurate clinical diagnosis. Offering better techniques to cancer centers and their patients could detect these abnormalities in the hundreds to thousands of cells stage, greatly improving treatment success. The functionalized nanoparticles will be more selective towards cancer cells than currently available technology, enabling diagnosis by spectroscopic methods including MRI at earlier stages of the cancers progression. In addition to enabling earlier detection, these materials also have potential for breakthroughs in treatment methods."

IDO-mediated tryptophan catabolism induces T cell suppression, which plays a physiological role in suppressing autoimmune and allergic diseases, as well as in facilitating maternal/fetal tolerance. IDO also plays a pathophysiological role in suppressing immune responses to tumors. Newlink Genetics Corporation has developed an IDO inhibitor, 1- methyl tryptophan (1-MT), as an immune stimulatory agent for cancer therapy. A multi-center phase I trial of 1-MT is currently underway. Compelling Preliminary Data indicate that IDO also plays biologically important, opposing roles (inhibition of the host response; inhibition of microbial replication) during diverse chronic infections. Specifically, our data indicate that: (a) IDO is counter-regulatory in cutaneous leishmaniasis (restraining inflammation and parasite clearance); (b) IDO is an antimicrobial effector in toxoplasmosis; and (c) IDO does not appear to alter the course of HSVI or Chlamydia pneumoniae infection. Of note, tuberculosis (TB) is associated with dramatic upregulation of IDO in lung lesions. Therapy for leishmaniasis, which causes a large burden of morbidity and mortality in the tropics, is prolonged; drug resistance is on the rise. The counter-regulatory activity of IDO provides a novel therapeutic target: inhibition should allow for shorter duration, more successful antibiotic therapy. Treatment of TB, one of the top infectious causes of death in the world, is hampered by the need for using multiple drugs for long periods and by increasing drug resistance. Whether IDO is counter-regulatory or antimicrobial in TB remains to be defined; either activity may provide a useful therapeutic target. In this Project, we aim to validate the scientific merit and technical feasibility of therapeutic targeting of IDO in leishmaniasis and TB, by: (1) validating preliminary data indicating therapeutic benefit for 1-MT in experimental leishmaniasis; and (2) defining the biological role of IDO in, and the utility of adjunctive 1-MT during antibiotic treatment of, experimental TB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal aims to validate the scientific merit and technical feasibility of therapeutic targeting of indolamine 2,3- deoxygenase (IDO) enzymes in leishmaniasis and TB, using an IDO inhibitor, 1-methyl tryptophan (1-MT), developed by Newlink Genetics Corporation as an immune stimulatory agent for cancer therapy."

Current state-of-the-art experimental control software has not been designed with this environment specifically in mind, creating a barrier to use for many hardware components, and resulting in many laboratories expending valuable resources to produce their own ad hoc solutions. This situation represents a commercial opportunity for an experimental control system that can provide seamless access to multiple data collection modalities in an intuitive and transparent interface. Paradigm Elements has been designed in response to this opportunity. Implemented as an extension to the Paradigm experimental control system, the *Elements* framework is designed to permit high-level access to a wide range of data acquisition devices using generic commands that are transparently integrated into the base software. In Phase I of this proposal, we developed and tested the overall Elements framework and implemented three prototype Elements: one each for particular EEG and eye-tracking systems, and an element for fMRI experiments. Technical tests revealed that Paradigm Elements met or exceeded all industrystandard measures of timing accuracy. Usability tests revealed a strong preference for Paradigm over its biggest competitor (E- Prime), including both objective measures of time on task and documentation, as well as subjective ratings and survey responses. In Phase II, we will build on these successes by developing new Elements for a wider range of hardware devices, and continuing to test them against technical and usability benchmarks. We will also take concrete steps to prepare for commercialization in Phase III by establishing contacts with hardware vendors in order to collaborate in the production of high-quality hardware integration products and to set the stage for potential licensing and distribution agreements. Successful completion of Phase II will result in a full complement of Paradigm Elements covering the most widely used data acquisition hardware, making Paradigm an essential tool for researchers in a wide range of disciplines that depend on these devices for their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE We are developing a software package that permits access to complex data acquisition hardware for researchers who lack the specific technical expertise to design their own device interfaces. The level of programming skill required to use many innovative and highly informative techniques is beyond the training of the researchers who could potentially make the best use of them. Therefore, this product has the potential for very high - if indirect - impact on public health by greatly improving the quality and efficiency of research across a wide range of biobehavioral disciplines."

In a CE system, analyte is drawn through a narrow channel using ion movement resulting in an electroosmotic flow (EOF) generated by a high voltage electric field. Most microchip CE methods reported in the literature use the same separation and detection method for every channel with the goal of high sample throughput of a single type of analyte. The successful lab- on-chip analysis system initially developed by the Lunte laboratory at the University of Kansas will be refined to create a modular, self-contained, turnkey tool for collection, separation analysis and wireless transmission of collected analyte from biological tissue. Commercialization of this device will result in an integrated high voltage power source, CE analysis chip, liquid pumping system and wireless data transmission unit robust enough for use in a remote field setting and easily accessible to the general research community. Development of the proposed product is a highly significant advancement over the current state-of-the art as it will empower researchers to make more detailed, regular measurements of neurotransmitter and nitric oxide metabolites while tying results to behavioral studies. Such observations provide critical knowledge of the link between normal behavior and functional neurochemistry. The modular components of this design will form the basis for a more sophisticated system of analysis for multiple classes of analytes such as peptides and amino acids simply by changing the chip and analysis instrument package while leaving the rest of the system unchanged. When complete, this proposal will move useful lab-on-chip technology previously developed by the Lunte group into the commercial marketplace by making a robust, portable microdialysis sampling and analysis tool easily implemented in any lab or field environment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Continuous sampling and analysis of brain neurotransmitter levels or tissue fluid in a self- contained, portable device will give researchers new ways to observe neurochemical changes associated with many disorders such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. According to recent reports by the Alzheimer's Association an Agency for Healthcare research, dementia and neurodegenerative disorders are likely to affect 1 in 5 baby boomers and could cost the U.S. health care system as much as  200 billion by 2015."

While a great deal of progress has been made in the field of Drosophila sleep research using available tools, there currently exists no instrument designed specifically for the accurate observation, recording and analysis of sleep (immobility) periods in the fruit fly. This proposal outlines a system explicitly designed to detect small amounts of motion in Drosophila and, therefore, estimate sleep more accurately than any available system. In conjunction with this detection device, we also propose the design of a mechanized system capable of automatically sleep depriving individual flies through a fully-programmable computerized interface. Accomplishment of these specific aims will involve a collaborative effort between Pinnacle Technology and the world-renowned Drosophila research team at The University of Pennsylvania. System prototyping and initial design will be undertaken by Pinnacle Technology while testing and refinement of the system will be accomplished by the University of Pennsylvania team. These two features, detection of small movements and automated individual sleep deprivation, combined and designed specifically to record and automatically analyze sleep in the fly, will provide a new and powerful tool for Drosophila researchers to explore the basic genetics underlying sleep. Technological innovations of this system will include enhanced video recognition software, mechanisms to observe up to 10 flies with a single, low-cost video camera and the technology to selectively deprive individual flies of sleep based on automated analysis. Commercial applications of such a device are already being sought by major pharmaceutical companies as they explore new ways of screening new compounds for improved sleep. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that at least 40 million Americans suffer each year from chronic, long-term sleep disorders while an additional 20 million experience occasional sleeping problems. Economically, poor sleep accounts for an estimated  16 billion in medical costs each year and the indirect costs of lost productivity and other factors are known to be much higher. While the links between inadequate sleep and poor health and productivity are becoming more and more clear, there is a dire need to understand the basic causes and biological need for sleep."

In order for local small family farms to grab a greater portion of food sales, they must get their locally grown foods on the mainstream supermarket shelves, as well as partner with stores to get foods to consumers in nontraditional ways, such as cCSAs. The food system plays a central role in the health of Kansas Citians. It dictates access, quality, affordability, and the nutritional value of the food we consume. The state of our health is inextricably related to the quality of our food system. Unfortunately, healthy, nutritious, accessible and affordable food eludes many people, which, in turn, undermines health. Gaps include hunger and food insecurity, lack of fair prices for farmers, lack of fresh local food in schools and institutional setting, lack of full service grocery stores in inner city food deserts, lack of knowledge on what food is nutritious, and lack of knowledge on how to prepare nutritious meals. Various organizations attempt to fill these gaps, and many alleviate suffering in the short run, but they lack the coordinated, broad-based structure and sufficient expertise and funds to provide comprehensive, ongoing solutions. GNFF has already successfully established an effective model to distribute locally grown foods from small family farms into mainstream supermarkets. Now they'd like to take that one step further, by providing the same service to Kansas City's inner city food deserts through a permutation of the CSA concept referred to as the `New Collaborative CSA' (cCSA). The cCSA will be developed as collaboration between Good Natured Family Farm Alliance, Balls Food Stores, Hallmark Cards, inner city community churches and Bistro Kids Farm 2 School Program. Each partner will provide an essential part to the cCSA, to aid those vulnerable populations in the inner city food deserts with access to local farm fresh food. In summary, the partnership between GNFF, Balls Food Stores, Hallmark Cards, an inner city community church, and Bistro Kids Farm 2 School program will: a) increase sales and revenue for GNFF farmers by giving them access to a new market of consumers, b) increase sales and revenue for Balls Food Stores by giving them access to a new market of consumers, and c) provide healthy, farm fresh, locally grown food to vulnerable populations in Kansas City's food deserts."

Most importantly, these agents do not appear to contain specific nucleic acid, and therefore all diagnostic techniques rely upon identification of the conformationally unique form. As a result, all successful post-mortem diagnostics to date rely upon the use of monoclonal antibodies. Although blood is clearly infectious and capable of transmitting disease, identification of PrPd within the blood of affected humans and experimental animals has been difficult. As a result, there is currently no approved antemortem diagnostic assay for TSE infection of either animals or humans. We propose to capitalize on the exquisite specificity of antibody-based diagnostics and the sensitivity of the Polymerase Chain Reaction to validate a PrPd-specific Immuno-PCR assay for TSEs. To accomplish this goal, we will (a) define the sensitivity of the Immuno-PCR assay for PrPd obtained from brain and lymphoid tissues of affected sheep; (b) Define the presence of PrPd within the blood of clinical end-stage scrapie-affected sheep and (c) Map the appearance of PrPd within the blood of experimentally infected animals throughout the course of infection. This work is novel, in that it capitalizes on the strengths of both nucleic-acid and protein-based assays. RTI has a track record in translational research on TSEs, and has established a partnership with PrionCyte to accomplish these goals. Following successful Phase I studies, we anticipate confirming these results in additional species through Phase II studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The United States collects approximately 15 million units of whole blood each year from an estimated 8 million volunteers (American Red Cross, http://www.pleasegiveblood.org/education/faq.php). Given the long asymptomatic and diagnostically-invisible incubation period of TSEs, FDA regulations now ban blood donations by individuals at risk for incubating variant CJD (vCJD), resulting in an estimated drop in already limited blood donations of approximately 500,000 units (http://www.americasblood.org). Identification of additional native cases of BSE, or the appearance of native cases of vCJD could result in further threats to the US blood supply. There is therefore an immediate and significant need for a highly sensitive, blood-based test for infectivity in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies."

It considers the AI experience as its frame of refere

signers and health science experts. Using a participatory approach, the specific objectives of Phase II include the design, development and evaluation of an obesity prevention intervention in the form of an interactive web based program with four main area
s: Science, Healthy Eating, Exercise and Family and Community. A curriculum will be developed as well as an expanded series of science modules using videogames as the centerpiece for learning while respecting the American Indian cultural and structural fra
mework. The performance and appearance of existing modules will be enhanced as well as the entrenching of a common  artistic/emotional heart  to deliver a visually seamless story from one videogame world to the next. The team will author teacher/facilitato
r support materials in the form of background information on videogames as educational tools, lesson plans, handouts, and assessments that aid users as they build science understandings and healthy lifestyle choices. The research goal is to research the ef
fectiveness of an inquiry-based curriculum using a culturally congruent, web-based video game as compared to the standard science and health curriculum. Specifically, the curriculum will address nutritional content related to how eating habits and other re
levant behaviors affect obesity in adolescents and teenagers. Concepts surrounding digestive system structure and function as well as the role of metabolism will frame the curriculum. The development team will travel and brainstorm with the American Indian
 Tribe participants 8 times in the first year and 4 times in the second year of the project. This component is crucial in order to identify and address the felt needs of the American Indian communities and successfully weave an American Indian culturally r
elevant thread throughout the program. Phase I Food for Thought gamers/student testers were truly engaged in game-play and after the completion of the prototypical learning module, still expressed interest in playing the games. The Phase II design team wil
l capitalize on the interest factor and product versatility expanding the target market to home school environments and community based organizations such as Boys' and Girls Clubs and the special supplemental nutrition program for Women, Infants, and Child
ren- better known as WIC. The discussion of product versatility naturally lends itself to commercial success. If a product proves to be versatile enough to warrant appeal in diverse markets, the product should produce measurable, genuine commercial success
. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Societal benefits of Creature Control include the intentional use of videogame technology for purposes of education. To date, few videogame developers have ventured into the educational gaming market because there is more money t
o make by creating games that strictly entertain. Many of these entertainment games boast challenging puzzles, intricate problems, and complex patterns to solve. Arguably, they are very educational. However, the content chosen rarely applies to middle and 
high school science concepts. In fact, many videogames receive scrutiny due to their content. This work-Creature Control-promotes the idea that appropriate and complex science concepts can be married with videogame play to create a fun and educational lear
ning experience."

is routine. In addition, rotorcraft engineers traditionally use the wind tunnel to evaluate and finalize designs. Estimation of rotor tunnel
blockage is significantly more complex than bluff body corrections as the correction depends on operational characteristics such as rotor RPM and thrust produced.

This proposal offers to develop an Integrated Design Environment (IDE) which can simulate a complete rotorcraft with or without wind tunnel walls including all the facility effects.

At the heart of the innovation are:

1. An automated hybrid grid generator (viscous grids near the bodies and 
unstructured Cartesian grid everywhere else).
2. A robust and economical incompressible flow solver for the entire system of grids.
3. Momentum source based rotor model that is suitable and economical 
for simulating configurations with multiple rotors.

In Phase I, the proof-of-concept developed used unstructured Cartesian 
grid for the model and wind tunnel. In phase II, the tool will be extended 
to hybrid grid with viscous grid near solid surfaces and will include several tools including a simple CAD like geometry manipulation tool and pre- and post-processing tools all integrated in one environment to facilitate ease of use."

We have developed a group of proprietary bisphosphonates containing isoprene substructures that demonstrate highly potent and specific inhibition of GGDPS in vitro. These compounds do not contain the hydroxyl group or the nitrogen substructure of the current clinical agents. We have recently seen some interesting in vivo antitumor activity for our current lead compound of the series, TTI-138 in a xenograft model of prostate cancer while showing essentially no signs of toxicity at the doses studied. This is in contrast to the currently used bisphosphonates such as zoledronate (Zometa, Novartis) which demonstrate activity against prostate cancer xenografts, at sites other than bone, only at clinically unachievable concentrations. While TTI-138 does show some efficacy we also see substantial inhibition of osteoclastic bone reasorption with this agent in an ex vivo model. We feel that further structure activity studies using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays would allow development of an agent with more desirable characteristics including lower bone affinity and higher activity in primary tumor models. Here we propose Phase I studies to prove the feasibility of this approach in prostate cancer treatment. These feasibility studies will be comprised of a large computer modeling study designed inhibitors within the active site of the enzyme. We will then carry out the synthesis of the compounds indicated by the modeling and test them in an expanded set of three prostate cancer cell lines for inhibition of GGDPS, migration and cell growth. We will concurrently test them in two models of bone affinity. These biological screens will be used to inform further refinement of the designed compounds. If we can identify highly specific inhibitors with low bone targeting we would move the compounds identified into Phase II studies entailing mouse xenograft models of prostate cancer, pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic analysis, in vivo models of bone affinity, and preliminary toxicology. Given the large number of patients who present with prostate cancer we feel compounds with low toxicity and favorable side-effects profiles can find a significant niche in the treatment of this disease. These studies would be the first examples advocating design of treatments targeting GGDPS for a non-bone related cancer indication. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance It was estimated that there would be approximately 186,000 new diagnoses of prostate cancer in 2008, and that deaths from this disease in that year will total almost 29,000. Despite treatment options for early disease stages many patients will eventually progress to a highly metastatic androgen independent form of this disease termed Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer (HRPC). Despite some recent advances in treatment HRPC's often become resistant to standard treatment regimens. In this proposal we advocate developing drugs based on inhibiting an un exploited biological process that is known to be important to prostate cancer progression. New therapies for HRPC could have large impacts on this patient population"

The ACS also estimates that 13,070 deaths will occur due to these diseases in this year. This Phase II STTR program advocates the development of drugs for primary CNS cancers from the schweinfurthin family of natural products. The schweinfurthins are a family of natural products isolated by the National Cancer Institute and have a unique pattern of activity against cancer cell lines indicating a potentially untapped and novel mechanism of action. This project will undertake the further development of these agents by carrying out three specific aims: 1) we will synthesize 288 new bis-stilbene analogs of the schweinfurthins aimed at providing more structure function data, improving activity and physical properties for this class of compounds; 2) we will test these compounds as they become available following an assay scheme developed in our Phase I feasibility studies, this will lead to testing of compounds in animal models of glioblastoma; and 3) we will undertake further hypothesis driven explorations of the mechanism of action of the schweinfurthins. The current clinical outcome of patients with glioblastoma and other aggressive CNS cancers makes development of new agents for these indications highly desirable. The three specific aims proposed here are designed to allow us to choose a candidate for IND enabling studies and to further our understanding of the mechanism of action of this novel family of compounds. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Primary glioma represents a significant challenge to the oncology community. While the incidence of glioma is relatively low at 5-10 per 100,000 individuals, therapeutic interventions for these diseases are of only marginal benefit. According to the American Cancer Society an estimated 21,810 cases of primary malignant brain tumor will be reported in the US in 2008. The ACS also estimates that 13,070 deaths will occur due to these diseases in this year. Research aimed at improving outcomes for this disease is clearly needed to address shortcomings in current therapies."

Current manufacturing and repair methods for curing Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) composite materials do not employ real time temperature feedback from the critical interior of parts or repair bond lines because no practical sensors can be permenantly embedded to report to a remote reader. This Phase II Project will lead to the commercialization of three complementary products designed to provide this capability so as to improve curing processes. Product 1 is an inexpensive microwire temperature sensor that is easy to use and does not negatively affect structural integrity. Product 2 is an autoclave/oven control system: modular antennas that reside inside the hot chamber and a reader with control software outside that combine to control the curing process via real-time temperature feedback from embedded sensors. Product 3 is a temperature-sensing accessory for all existing portable composite repair systems. This accessory allows existing repair systems, without modification, to monitor temperature from embedded Product 1 sensors. These complementary products will vastly improve legacy curing processes by cutting curing times, reducing labor, and reducing the number of rejected parts due to uncontrolled exotherm.  The commercial aircraft industry's rapidly expanding use of CFRP composites is driving the marketplace demand for process
enhancements that increase efficiency, yield and part quality. If successful the outcome of this project will address the needs of control system manufacturing companies, end-user companies and commercial aircraft manufacturers. The low cost of the microwire sensors and the anticipated improvements to the speed of legacy curing processes both for initial cure and repair may accelerate the use of CFRP composites within the automobile industry. This should result in reduced fuel/energy usage worldwide. Furthermore, the extremely low thermal mass of these microwire temperature sensors gives them such fast thermal response that they may allow for the development of unconventional and faster composite curing systems and processes that employ real time feedback, such as microwave ovens for initial cure and induction heating devices for repair cure, further speeding overall industry use of composites. Finally, microwire temperature sensing technology holds promise for remote measurement of internal temperatures of lithium ion batteries for electric and hybrid cars."

The method, known as SEAL, will allow researchers to construct DNA libraries containing only these variations. This would be a breakthrough in technology as whole genome sequencing produces vast amounts of redundant data representing the test genome?s regions that are identical to the control genome. Using current sequencing technologies this redundant data imposes high generation and analysis costs without contributing any new information. This project will demonstrate the method?s feasibility by developing robust bacterial genome analysis applications. Each step of the multi-staged method will be tested to find optimal conditions. Phase II aims will be developing more complex human genomic applications.  The broader impacts of this research are on how DNA sequencing is performed and DNA variation is assessed. Research areas impacted include: pharmacogenomic assessment for personalized medicine diagnostics, notably in cancer treatment; simpler, less data-intensive methods to collect the genetic variation information required for understanding complex diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and tools for discovery of new antibiotics for drug-resistant pathogens. The commercial value will be a dramatic decrease in the cost and time of genome sequencing, identification of biomarkers associated with appropriate treatments and decreased requirements for very high cost sequencing equipment."

The recent advent of commercial turn-key, high power femtosecond lasers has prompted a great amount of interest in using femtosecond lasers for machining. It has been demonstrated that the femtosecond laser has potential for achieving high precision owing to its extremely confined heat-affected zone. The objective of the proposed research is to develop a novel femtosecond laser micromachining technology based on temporally-shaped femtosecond pulses for DoD and other applications, including drilling shaped film-cooling holes in turbine blades. In these femtosecond pulses, the temporal shape and energy of each pulse, and the pulse-to-pulse separation time are all designed and adjusted at a time scale from femtosecond to nanosecond to overcome common problems associated with laser machining and maximize the machining speed. We will also implement diagnostic techniques to provide a feedback for process monitoring and laser parameter control. This will be based on laser-plasma emission for identifying materials and machining rates. In this project, we will focus on optimizing the pulse shapes for machining of film-cooling holes in turbine blades. However, the technique to be developed is generally applicable for machining a wide variety of other materials.

The proposed fiber-based CARS system will also be fully capable of nanosecond operation with the addition of a nanosecond pump laser provided by the customer.  It will be tested in laboratory hydrocarbon-air flames followed by evaluation in an augmentor test-rig at WPAFB, OH.  These measurements will allow optimizing the CARS system in preparation for measurements in the AEDC J85 test rig.  During the Phase-II research effort, we will build on successful Phase I studies of fiber-optic beam propagation and focus our attention on pulsed-laser propagation through solid- and hollow-core photonic crystal fibers.  The CARS system will be built in such a way so as to incorporate both multimode step-index fibers and photonic crystal fibers.  The unique feature of the ps-CARS technique for fiber delivery is that it requires two orders of magnitude less energy per laser pulse compared to the conventional nanosecond CARS and affords an improvement in damage threshold.  We will also design and build a special collimator to facilitate raster scanning with the fiber-based CARS system.  This fiber collimator will allow two- or three-dimensional scanning of the flow field.  The proposed research effort will provide new diagnostic capabilities that will enable the Air Force and gas-turbine system manufacturers to address the challenges associated with high-speed reacting and non-reacting flows.  BENEFIT:   The proposed research effort will provide new diagnostic capabilities that will enable the Air Force and gas-turbine system manufacturers to address the challenges associated with high-speed reacting and non-reacting flows. These tools are critical for the development and long-term health of propulsion systems for high-performance military as well as commercial systems.  The proposed research will also help to advance the state of fiber technology for optical diagnostics through numerical modeling of light propagation through the optical fibers.  Quantitative measurements are critical for validating numerical models of reacting and non-equilibrium phenomena affecting modern gas-turbine and hypersonic propulsion systems.  Such experimental and numerical tools will prove to be extremely valuable in the analysis of military and commercial gas-turbine combustors, as well as applications with limited optical access such as internal combustion engines and stationary power generation systems."

Although nonlinear protection elements have been successfully employed in the past, fast ultra wideband (UWB) and high power microwave (HPM) signals are not successfully blocked by most current circuit protection technologies.    This proposal details the development of a quasi-passive, solid state electro-optic terminal protection system (EOTPS) to effectively block UWB and HPM signals from the front end of radar systems.  The device uses power from the incoming transient to switch the signal line to ground.  But because the system as a whole requires no external power other than the transient, it can be considered a passive device.  Inherent delay in the system permits the switch to become fully conductive before the transient arrives, effectively creating a system with a negative switching time.  This allows the entire transient to be reflected, in contrast to other high power terminal protection techniques which allow part of the transient to pass to the LNA."

Otto applies innovative research and techniques in order to yield a visual-based navigation capability for station keeping and approach to landing. Our concept uses video input to guide an unmanned aircraft through an approach pattern and provide a constant-glideslope descent to the touchdown point. It requires no powered equipment on the ground and works with any existing UAV that has a camera capable of facing forward on approach. No changes are required on the aircraft as the Otto concept is a software upgrade required in the Ground Control Station only.

The problem is compounded by complex modern urban areas and modern rules of engagement often preclude the use of wide area offensive tactics.  Consequently dismounted forces are called to enter challenging hostile terrain in search of select enemy targets.  Many of these respondents are injured or killed each year due to improvised explosive devices detonated from remote locations.  War fighters injured by these explosions often have significant loss of blood that leads to shock, which results in inadequate organ perfusion and tissue oxygenation. Hemorrhage is therefore a major cause of soldier death in the modern day battlefield.  Resuscitation from shock aims to correct the mismatch between available oxygen and the demands of critical organs.  Accurate knowledge of partial oxygen pressure, the oxygen saturation, and the pH of the peripheral muscle tissue support a successful resuscitation procedure.  Therefore, this project will develop technology for a miniature device able to measure these parameters. The proposed system will utilize ultra bright directive light emitters with narrow photon energy spread in the 660nm to 1050nm spectrum. Each sensing objective will be optimized on a 3-layer phantom using an artificial neural network classifier scheme already proven to extract very reliable signals from highly cluttered ultra wide band raw data. The artificial neural network training strategy will take into account issues such as inhomogeneous medium, variation of light intensities, lack of monochromatic light sources, and the relation between light absorption, scatter and reflections. Under ideal conditions, the accuracy is expected exceed 95%."

Protein crystallization is an intermediate step in determining the precise three-dimensional shape of a protein, and proteins are involved in virtually every cellular process.  Precise knowledge of the three-dimensional shapes of proteins is very useful in a wide variety of applications, especially in predicting which drug candidates (each with a known shape) can bind to and potentially alter a particular protein?s function.  It would also allow specific design of drugs to bind to sites identified on a target protein, thus increasing the potential for regulation of that protein.  The broader impacts of this research will be a drastic reduction in the amount of time, money, and human effort necessary to develop new drugs thereby improving general overall health and reducing the cost of healtcare.  Since many diseases are caused by perturbations in the function of one or more proteins in a cellular pathway, a method for quick and inexpensive analysis of protein structure would have far-reaching benefits to patients worldwide. Improvements in structural data acquisition will streamline basic proteomics research and revolutionize the process of drug discovery and development through enhanced scientific and technological understanding of underlying processes. The commercial value of this project arises from substantial conservation of manpower and funding, and will allow large pharmaceutical companies, as well as smaller
biotechnology companies and academic scientists, to extend and enhance their research programs."

Ultrasound techniques have the potential to benefit the swine industry for improvements in both quality and yield measures by non-destructive means. There is a need to continually improve percentage intramuscular fat estimation accuracy and reduced bias, especially before integration of percentage IMF levels into payment systems. A unique opportunity exists due to recent availability of a programmable ultrasound scanner with access to both unprocessed, radio frequency (RF) ultrasound backscattered signals and corresponding B-mode images, and recent reports that combining parameters from both signals and images improves accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for tissue characterization. We hypothesize that the accuracy of percentage IMF estimation in the longissimus dorsi muscle can be improved by combining the RF signal analysis with currently used B-mode
image texture analysis. Technical objectives are to: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneously acquiring B-mode images and RF signals from live animals and carcasses using the new generation of programmable digital ultrasound scanner; and 2) develop signal processing parameters for characterizing percentage IMF and prove that by combining parameters derived from RF signals with texture parameters from images, percentage IMF estimation can be improved. Phase I will include developing a protocol to acquire both ultrasound images and RF signals using a state-of-the-art ultrasound research system; in-house testing of the system, and developing procedures for scanning and processing data. The Phase I output will be the proof-of-concept that RF ultrasound signals can enhance existing image processing-based IMF prediction in swine. To our knowledge, this would be the first feasibility study to integrate ultrasound data collection and processing of both B-mode images and RF signals in
ultrasound applications for food animals. Phase II will culminate in developing a prototype integrated acquisition and processing system for evaluation of feedlot animals and carcasses. The proposed hybrid system has the potential to significantly improve marketable ultrasound technology and have a long lasting impact on food animal industries.

The CFTR gene encodes a chloride channel that regulates ion flow across epithelial cell membranes. Most
 CF patients have a mutation that deletes phenylalanine 508 (?F508) and prevents CFTR from being properly processed and delivered to cell membranes. Failure of CFTR to reach the cell surface in the lung disrupts the composition and quantity of the airway s
urface liquid, and through mechanisms not yet fully understood, begins a cascade of events that leads to chronic airway infection and inflammation and lung destruction. Despite improvements in the lives of patients with CF, it remains a lethal disease, and
 current treatments are directed at secondary manifestations rather than the underlying defect. Several studies have demonstrated that the ?F508-CFTR channel retains chloride channel function when it is experimentally delivered to the cell membrane. Thus, 
the ?F508-CFTR channel has become an important therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention. However, two barriers limit progress toward new treatments. First, lack of an animal model that develops lung disease is a major impediment to understanding
 disease pathogenesis and the development of effective therapies. Mice with CFTR knockouts and with the ?F508 mutation have been developed, but they fail to exhibit the airway infection and inflammation that cause most of the morbidity and mortality in pat
ients. Second, the ?F508-CFTR protein from other species shows differences in its processing compared to human ?F508-CFTR. Thus, studies focused on understanding CF and developing new treatments require a new animal model expressing the human ?F508-CFTR. I
n this application, we propose to produce such a model. We will use pigs for this project, because in contrast to mice, the structure, physiology, and biochemistry of their lungs and airways closely resemble those of humans. The ultimate goal of this proje
ct is to develop and commercialize a porcine model of CF carrying a human CFTR transgene bearing the common ?F508 mutation. A  humanized  ?F508 pig would be the ideal model in which to develop and test CF drugs and a valuable tool for answering persistent 
questions about CF pathogenesis. This proposal outlines the development of such a pig by first stably introducing the entire human CFTR gene bearing the ?F508 mutation into the genome of pig cells lacking endogenous pig CFTR expression. The transgenic cell
s will then be used as nuclear donors for somatic cell nuclear transfer. The resulting pigs will be characterized molecularly, biochemically, and electrophysiologically to determine ?F508-CFTR expression and function. To validate the human ?F508-CFTR trans
genic pig as a relevant model in which to test new therapies, pig airway cultures will be established, and compounds known to partially rescue the processing of ?F508-CFTR in human tissues will be tested. This project will generate an animal model that wil
l provide the CF industrial and academic community with an opportunity to better understand the disease and its pathogenesis and to develop and test new therapeutics and preventative strategies. Thus, this work will accelerate the discovery of novel therap
ies for this lethal disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will generate an animal model that will provide the cystic fibrosis academic and industrial community with an opportunity to better understand the disease and its pathogenesis and to develo

e H or more recently by ribozyme activity. Current excitement has focused on RNAi that uses a distinct mechanism where oligonucleotides trigger an endogenous pre-existing gene suppression pathway that is fundamental to cellular gene regulatory networks. In
 spite of its general success, some mRNAs are only modestly downregulated (2-fold) by RNAi and others are refractory. Further, certain off-target effects can arise leading to unexpected consequences, underscoring the need for additional methods. The rapid 
rise of the RNAi field has led to an increased appreciation, of direct relevance to the present proposal, that regulatory sequence elements in mRNA 3' ends (eg. 3'UTRs) control the expression of that gene. Here we present preliminary data on the developmen
t of a new gene silencing technology that uses oligonucleotides annealing to specific sequence regions within the 3'UTR to inhibit pre-mRNA processing. We plan to improve this new technology by systematically analyzing modified bases to increase inhibitory
 activity. We will also determine how robust the technology is by testing its effectiveness in a variety of human cell types as well as cells from other vertebrates and by silencing several endogenous human genes as a proof-of-principle. Finally, we will a
lso determine whether enhanced inhibition is seen when this new technology is used in conjunction with other gene silencing technologies such as RNAi where enhancement is expected because these different methods utilize fundamentally distinct mechanisms. W
e believe this new technology will make a significant addition to our gene silencing toolkit and may even aid emerging oligonucleotide-based therapies, although that is beyond the scope of this proposal.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The commercialization of 
this new U1 Adaptor mediated gene silencing technology will be a significant addition to the scientific research community's  gene silencing toolkit . Because this method exploits a distinctly different mechanism compared to more common gene silencing appr
oaches, it has the potential of enhancing these traditional technologies when used in combination with them via synergistic effects. This may aid in the development of emerging oligonucleotide-based gene silencing therapies by improving sensitivity and eff
icacy."

In a security screening system, measured optical properties might be used to distinguish, independent of shape, between threat and background materials.  Improved optical elements for increasingly advanced THz systems will require optical constants and instrumentation for design and quality control.  Measured THz optical properties are intrinsically connected to underlying low-energy physical processes and thereby allow testing of existing scientific theories and exploration of novel developments such as artificially structured meta-materials.  Ellipsometry is the preeminent technique for accurate, quantitative determination of complex-valued optical constants and for non-destructively characterizing layered structures.  The J. A. Woollam Co. proposes developing a variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometer for operation at terahertz (THz) frequencies as an addition to the company’s existing line of ellipsometers, which span frequencies from the infrared (IR-VASE®, 10 to 150 THz) to the vacuum ultraviolet (VASE® 150 to 2000 THz).  Work by Drs. Mathias Schubert and Tino Hofmann at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) in far-infrared and THz ellipsometry using frequency-domain techniques shows promise.

IGCC has many advantages over traditional technologies including: higher efficiency, lower pollutant emissions, and a possibility of carbon capture and sequestration. One of the remaining challenges for the IGCC is the need to develop a cleanup technology to remove reduced sulfur and nitrogen compounds from the hot fuel gas at gasification operating temperatures.

NanoScale Corporation proposed development of nanocrystalline sorbents and catalysts for hot gas cleanup technology to allow for removal of reduced sulfur (H2S and COS) and ammonia pollutants from coal-generated fuel gases at gasification operating temperatures. In Phase I, several sorbents and catalysts were synthesized and evaluated with real fuel gas from the gasifier at Western Research Institute (WRI). These sorbents and catalysts were tailored to selectively react with reduced sulfur and nitrogen compounds present in fuel gas and were found to be immune to other components of the fuel gas. Two materials, a sorbent for removal of reduced sulfur pollutants and a catalyst for ammonia decomposition, were found to be particularly effective approach proposed by NanoScale utilizes manufacturing methods that are easily scalable, cost efficient, and environmentally friendly.

In the proposed Phase II project, the most effective Phase I materials will be optimized, and their ideal predominance parameters will also be determined to enable most efficient operation under IGCC fuel gas conditions. The testing will include both laboratory scale experiments, as well as pilot-scale demonstrations with real fuel gas at WRI. The results of the proposed project should clearly demonstrate the advantage of using nanocrystalline materials for hot fuel gas cleanup and the feasibility of the NanoScale approach.

The proposed project offers environmental benefits that can revolutionize current control methods by providing sorbent and catalyst materials that are technically superior to existing materials. Possible applications of the proposed technology include IGCC plants and other pollution control systems. Benefits offered by nanocrystalline sorbents, including enhanced chemical kinetics and increased removal capacities, have been demonstrated for many toxic chemicals and pollutants.

NanoScale is uniquely qualified for the proposed development since it is a leader in the field of reactive nanocrystalline materials."

no cure for osteoporosis, the FDA has approved the use of certain drugs to prevent and treat osteoporosis. These drugs, especially those directed against bone resorption, cause undesirable side effects and may not significantly reduce fracture risk in the 
target populations. Thus, there is a critical need to identify new and better therapeutics that would result in better patient outcomes. This proposal is aimed at authenticating novel drugs that increase bone deposition, rather than prevent resorption, to 
offset the bone loss of osteoporosis. Furthermore, this proposal will establish a dosage regime and delivery, and show proof of concept in animals."

and oxidative stress signaling has offered some important clues that boost hope for development of novel neuroprotective strategies for PD. In this regard, we uncovered a key apoptotic cell death pathway during oxidative insult in PD models involving the p
roteolytic activation of a novel PKC isoform, PKC4, by caspase-3 to promote apoptosis in dopaminergic neurons. Suppression of proteolytic activation of PKC4 using dominant negative mutants, a caspase-cleavage site resistant mutant, or siRNAs completely res

a series of new PKC4 small molecule inhibitors and optimize them to identify lead compounds with a high therapeutic index. The specific objectives of the proposal are: i) To design and synthesize a series of novel PKC4 inhibitor analogs, ii) To profile the
 selectivity and inhibitory potency of PKC4 inhibitors using a high throughput kinase profiling system, iii) To determine the potential neuroprotective effects of the PKC4 inhibitors in cell culture models of PD. The combination of a validated therapeutic 
target, integrative study design, and excellent expertise will help us accomplish these important goals. We anticipate identifying a set of lead compounds for testing in PD animal models for future Phase-II application. The overall approach is expected to 
lead to development of a mechanism- based neuroprotective agent for treatment of PD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson's disease is a major progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the cardinal motor symptoms of rigidity, bradykinesia, trem
ors, and postural instability. The existing therapeutic approach for Parkinson's disease only treats the symptoms and fails to prevent the progression of the neurodegenerative process. Recently, we identified that PKC4 is a novel therapeutic target for dev
elopment of neuroprotective agents because the kinase plays a key role in apoptotic cell death of nigral dopaminergic neurons. The proposed studies will develop a series of small molecule PKC4 inhibitors and evaluate their neuroprotective properties in Par
kinson's disease models. Overall, the knowledge gained from this proposal will lead to development of an effective neuroprotective drug for treatment of Parkinson's disease."

as rotor RPM and thrust produced.
This proposal offers to develop a design tool, which can simulate a complete 
rotorcraft inside a wind tunnel including all the facility effects.
At the heart of the innovation are:
1. An automated hybrid grid generator.
2. A robust and economical incompressible flow solver for the 
grid system.
3. Momentum source based rotor model that is suitable and economical 
for simulating multiple rotors including the drive fans of the wind tunnel.
Phase I will develop the proof-of-concept and will use unstructured Cartesian

diffuser, test section and nozzle. 
In phase II, the tool will be extended to hybrid grid with viscous grid near

Existing photoresist removal methods (plasma ashing and wet chemical stripping) are proving too aggressive for current state-of-the-art interconnect materials-they tend to degrade and damage low-k dielectrics and corrode copper; they are also detrimental to the delicate device structures.  In this project the resist stripping and wafer cleaning are accomplished in a single process step through controlled microcavitation in ultrapure water with no damage to the underlying layers and features.

For example, the transplantation of islets from human cadaveric donors has reversed type 1 
diabetes for many recipients, making them insulin independent. Unfortunately, there are not nearly enough human organ donors to satisfy the need. Only about 0.1% of the 1.5 million Americans with T1D receive an islet transplant each year. Furthermore, they

IGCC has many advantages over traditional technologies including: higher efficiency, lower pollutant emissions, and a possibility of carbon capture and sequestration. One of the remaining challenges for the IGCC is the need to develop a cleanup technology to remove reduced sulfur and nitrogen compounds from the hot fuel gas at gasification operating temperatures.



NanoScale Corporation proposed development of nanocrystalline sorbents and catalysts for hot gas cleanup technology to allow for removal of reduced sulfur (H2S and COS) and ammonia pollutants from coal-generated fuel gases at gasification operating temperatures. In Phase I, several sorbents and catalysts were synthesized and evaluated with real fuel gas from the gasifier at Western Research Institute (WRI). These sorbents and catalysts were tailored to selectively react with reduced sulfur and nitrogen compounds present in fuel gas and were found to be immune to other components of the fuel gas. Two materials, a sorbent for removal of reduced sulfur pollutants and a catalyst for ammonia decomposition, were found to be particularly effective approach proposed by NanoScale utilizes manufacturing methods that are easily scalable, cost efficient, and environmentally friendly.



In the proposed Phase II project, the most effective Phase I materials will be optimized, and their ideal predominance parameters will also be determined to enable most efficient operation under IGCC fuel gas conditions. The testing will include both laboratory scale experiments, as well as pilot-scale demonstrations with real fuel gas at WRI. The results of the proposed project should clearly demonstrate the advantage of using nanocrystalline materials for hot fuel gas cleanup and the feasibility of the NanoScale approach.



The proposed project offers environmental benefits that can revolutionize current control methods by providing sorbent and catalyst materials that are technically superior to existing materials. Possible applications of the proposed technology include IGCC plants and other pollution control systems. Benefits offered by nanocrystalline sorbents, including enhanced chemical kinetics and increased removal capacities, have been demonstrated for many toxic chemicals and pollutants.



NanoScale is uniquely qualified for the proposed development since it is a leader in the field of reactive nanocrystalline materials."

Current acoustic liners are passive by nature. This is a drawback because they are only able to absorb acoustic energy over a limited bandwidth.  A possible solution to this drawback is the development of an active acoustic liner.  The main advantage of this concept is the ability to tune the acoustic impedance for optimal attenuation at variable operating conditions.  In this proposal we outline the development of a piezoelectric acoustic liner that is capable of adapting its attenuation characteristics to the various flight regimes, thus making it a candidate for an active acoustic liner.  The liner is active because an electrical excitation is applied to the piezoelectric element causing the porous face sheet to vibrate at a prescribed frequency and displacement.  Preliminary results have demonstrated that the active liner can improve the absorption characteristics compared to a passive liner. To build upon these results, a computational model will be developed during Phase I to predict the acoustic absorption properties of the piezoelectric actuator and the perforated liner sheet.  Then during option portion of Phase I, the computational model will be further developed and experiments will be run to optimize the liner performance."

Moreover, as improvements are made in mass spectrometers, the use of these instruments is bound to increase and as such robust and intuitive programs for data analysis will be in demand.  The mass resolution and characterization of the surface profiles of heterogeneous material such as cells achieved by ToF-SIMS and ATR-IR results in the generation of large quantities of useful data that require equally powerful algorithms to analyze and visualize.

While several sensors currently exist for measuring temperature, relative humidity, shock/vibration, and other key parameters, the wiring required for such a network of embedded sensors, specially for munitions, would be difficult to install and maintain. The wiring harness adds weight and complexity to the missile system, which could be avoided by using a wireless network. But the wireless system would have to work in the complex RF environment within a missile system, and not cause unintended intitiation of electro-explosive components within the missile. Also, such a wireless system would have to be low power, to maintain safety in a potentially explosive environement, and for long-term functioning. The goal of the proposed effort is to develop such a low-power, long-life, safe wireless network for embedded sensors in a missile system, which provides remote end-users with accurate, near real-time health status awareness information for munitions."

The goal for the alarm system is to provide continuous noninvasive measurements during the sleep period of an individual with diabetes, sounding an audible alarm to wake the person if an impending hypoglycemic event is detected. The system will be based on continuous spectral measurements in the combination near infrared region. Through the use of a customized Fourier transform spectrometer and novel fiber-optic interface, transmission measurements will be made through the thin skin on the back of the hand of the sleeping person. The patient will initiate the monitoring session by performing a conventional finger-stick glucose measurement and acquiring a corresponding reference spectrum. Subsequent spectra will be referenced to this initial spectrum, and a novel pattern classification algorithm will be used to detect hypoglycemic events. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments are proposed in this Phase I application to optimize the hardware and software components of the alarm system. Glucose clamp experiments performed with Sprague-Dawley rats will be used to establish the performance characteristics of the spectrometer hardware, fiber-optic interface, and alarm algorithm. In addition, optimization of the fiber-optic interface will be aided by experiments performed with a population of human subjects. Through these studies, the feasibility of the proposed nocturnal alarm will be evaluated in preparation for a potential Phase II development effort.    Hypoglycemia is a potentially life-threatening condition where blood glucose concentrations drop below normal values. Episodes of severe hypoglycemia contribute significantly to the morbidity and mortality of individuals with type I diabetes and recurrent hypoglycemia can result in long-lasting damage to brain function including memory loss and degradation of other cognitive functions. Nocturnal hypoglycemia is particularly troublesome for many individuals with type I diabetes because it can go undetected and it is one component in the progression of hypoglycemic unawareness. The proposed nocturnal alarm represents an innovative approach to reduce significantly the frequency of hypoglycemic occurrences. Our approach is noninvasive, thereby avoiding confounding issues associated with biocompatibility and infection that plague implantable biosensor technologies."

To evaluate the feasibility of this type of instruction software programs will be designed to teach common prefixes, suffixes, and words parts; two research-validated vocabulary learning strategies; and provide multiple opportunities for students to apply their knowledge of word parts and use of learned strategies to high frequency academic vocabulary. Validated instructional principles such as detailed description and multiple levels of practice with feedback will be embedded into each segment of the programs. Segments will include an overview of the strategy, rationale for learning and purpose of using the strategy, detailed descriptions of each steps, video clips of students using the strategy in real testing situations, practice activities, and checks for understanding. To test the efficacy of the programs, revisions to each program will be made based on findings of the feasibility studies. Once revisions are completed, full-blown field tests for each IM program will be completed with approximately 120 middle and high school students with HID. The feasibility and validation studies will focus on (a) usability of the program, (b) student knowledge of the content and skills, (c) student use of the content and skills, (d) social validity of the program, and (e) social validity of the model. This project is relevant to public health because the number of individuals with low literacy skills is substantial. Particularly, many students with high incidence disabilities struggle with various aspects of reading and literacy-related skills. A large number of these students will either drop-out of school or continue to struggle throughout their school careers and into adulthood. Low literacy has been associated with such poor adult outcomes as under- and unemployment, increased criminal activity, and poverty. The empirically validated IM products that will result from this project will address the potentially devastating effects that low literacy can cause in children's lives and in society at large. Since vocabulary development is seen as a bridge between emerging reading skills and comprehension, this project has the potential to help many students expand their literacy skills. The instruction would be used to help them learn common words parts, independently remember meanings of new words, and expand their use of new words, and apply their skills to hundreds of new high-frequency, high-utility words. The instructional programs that will result from this project will be usable as literacy intervention programs based on individual needs. In addition, the proposed programs will serve as a model for the development of future IM programs for individuals with high incidence disabilities."

Galfenol is uniquely suited for use in low frequency transducers because of its formability, relatively high tensile strength, and relatively high magnetic permeability all of which allow the use of complex shapes to drive transducers.  Two Galfenol spring transducer concepts will be investigated:  a slotted cylinder transducer with a Gaflenol spring instead of a piezoceramic driver, and a simple double or four headed piston with Galfenol spring drivers.

The proposed work will investigate two different modifications to the split ring structure that allow its resonance frequency to be adjusted under active control so that it is always operated at or near its resonance.  Because the transducer is always operated at resonance, the phase of its input impedance is approximately constant, vastly simplifying the design of the transmit power amplifier and reducing the size and weight of the system. A high Q system is desirable for an actively tuned system resulting in very high efficiency and allowing the use of less expensive shell materials.  The first concept for a variable compliance transducer would replace a section of the shell near the hinge with a magnetostrictive portion; the compliance would be adjusted using the ""Delta E"" effect which changes modulus of the active material with stress and magnetic state and thus shifts the transducer resonance.  The second concept utilizes stiffening members located near the hinge of the ring; the stiffening members are selectively actuated to change the compliance of the ring and shift the transducer resonance.  Both these concepts are broadband, efficient transducers that can reach source levels in excess of 210 dB, resonant frequency less than 1 kHz, and bandwidth greater than 200 Hz."

PRRS is estimated to cost pork producers in the U.S. nearly $600 million annually and with a national eradication effort being proposed, the need for a second generation vaccine tool that is effective and safe is crucial. The use of a vector such as replicon particles (RP) merges subunit and modified live technologies to safely induce protective immunity by mimicking natural infection. The PD and collaborators have recently demonstrated the effectiveness of using RP vaccines in pigs and the importance of co-expressing PRRSV GP5 and M proteins in protection against PRRS. We have also described a method of producing autogenous replicon particle (ARP) vaccines using clinical samples from infected pigs. In this study, the feasibility of producing ARP vaccines in a timely matter will be studied and compared to the production time of traditional autogenous vaccines. The effectiveness and safety of the PRRSV ARP vaccine will be determined via comparison to currently available vaccines for PRRS including modified live vaccine (MLV) and traditional autogenous killed vaccine. It is anticipated that the PRRSV ARP vaccine along with the advantages of safety, specificity, and decreased production time will exhibit comparable or superior performance compared to other vaccines in a vaccination-challenge model and as measured by clinical signs, lesions, and viral load. We believe that a novel competitive PRRSV product would generate rapid market share growth due to improved production for the customer and compatibility with eradication programs."

Oligomers are generally used in experiments where they anneal to complementary sequences. Accurate predictions of annealing processes and duplex stability are therefore critical for design of such experiments. Nearest-neighbor model and thermodynamic parameters have been highly successful in predicting stability of native DNA and RNA duplexes. Dozens of useful chemical modifications of nucleic acids that give new properties to synthetic oligomers have been introduced (e.g., phosphorothioates, 2-O'-methyl RNA, locked nucleic acids (LNA), biotin, 5-nitroindole). However, these modifications are not widely used because their thermodynamic parameters are often unknown and effects of modifications on duplex stability cannot be accurately predicted. Our long-term goal, then, is to develop new, faster methods to measure thermodynamic parameters and to use these methods to determine parameters for various chemical modifications of nucleic acids, so that design of oligomers containing modifications is improved. We propose a novel fluorescence melting method that could provide thermodynamic parameters at least 10 times faster than traditional ultraviolet spectroscopic and calorimetric methods. The approach takes advantage of high-throughput real-time PCR systems (e.g. Bio-Rad iCycler) that can be modified to obtain equilibrium melting profiles. To demonstrate feasibility of the novel method in Phase I, we will determine unknown thermodynamic parameters for locked nucleic acids. We are requesting funding for the specific aims of: i) development of high-throughput fluorescence method for measurements of thermodynamic parameters, ii) application of the fluorescence method to determine unknown thermodynamic parameters for locked nucleic acid modifications. Synthetic DNA and RNA oligomers containing chemical modifications (e.g., locked nucleic acids, phosphorothioate DNAs, 2'-O-methyl RNAs) are used for both diagnosis and treatment of disease. We propose to develop a fluorescence melting method that could promptly determine effects of these modifications on DNA and RNA duplex stability. Such improved understanding of duplex stability for chemically modified nucleic acids will help design more accurate and efficient diagnostic tests and medical experiments."

DO sensors are primary monitors of water quality in industrial wastewater treatment. The new sensor is based on a pioneering platform for PL-based biochemical sensors where the excitation source is a pulsed organic light emitting device (OLED) pixel array that is structurally integrated with the sensor component. The individually addressable pixels and the sensor film are fabricated on either side of the glass substrate. The photodetector is behind the OLED array, monitoring the PL passing between the OLED pixels. This uniquely simple structural integration enables multi-sensor fabrication on a single, compact substrate, and should therefore yield field-deployable micro-sensor arrays for simultaneous detection of various analytes.  This sensor has applicability in water quality measurements in wastewater treatment, power, pulp and paper, chemical, food, beverage, brewing, and pharmaceuticals
plants, fish farms, fresh water, coastlines, and the oceans. Current sensors suffer from key drawbacks that limit their utility and application. Electrochemical sensors require frequent calibration and maintenance, and are typically slow to respond. PL-based sensors are expensive due to intricate design. The proposed sensor will be reliable, require very little maintenance/calibration, and will be inexpensive, with a flexible design and size. The proposed device will be uniquely simple, initially palm-size and eventually micro-size, autonomous, fast, miserly on power consumption, and inexpensive. It will be structurally integrated and will operate in a pulsed PL-lifetime mode, eliminating the need for optical components and frequent calibration."

These silver structures have been studied in great detail for their ability to increase fluorescent intensities when deposited onto solid surfaces, such as glass or quartz. Little information exists, however, on the ability of silver nanostructures to enhance fluorophores deposited onto porous membrane surfaces. The overall objective of this proposal is to use metal enhanced fluorescence to increase near- infrared fluorescence emissions on membrane substrates. Membrane based assays, such as western blots are routinely used in clinical settings to confirm serious diagnoses suggested by other screening tests, and in research settings to characterize and quantitate proteins of interest. Fluorescence based assays in the near-infrared offer the additional advantage of significantly lowering the background compared to that generated in the visible spectrum, helping to lower the limit of detection. In the long term, this work should be applicable to most systems that utilize fluorescence in a manner that traps the fluorescent dyes on a membrane substrate. Near-infrared metal enhanced fluorescence on membrane surfaces should provide a reliable and efficient procedure to increase fluorescent emissions and decrease the limit of detection, providing a tool that is compatible with current proteomic and genomic applications. Future endeavors could use metal enhanced fluorescence to increase the detectability of membrane based DNA, protein, and antibody arrays on membranes. This project focuses on developing an enhancement reagent for Western and dot blot analyses, which integrates the use of low background near-infrared LI-COR dyes with Metal Enhanced Fluorescence (MEF), to produce more sensitive membrane based assays capable of reducing the limit of detection by an order of magnitude. Advances in sensitivity for these Western and dot blot assays will aid in the analysis of molecular, cellular, and inter-cellular processes, and the relationship of these processes with respect to one another."

This effort will be the firs step in the commercialization of a technique for augmenting electrostatic MEMS devices through hermetically packaging them in a gas chemistry that possesses a relative permittivity significantly greater than one, which results in an equivalent gain in each of the fundamental equations governing the performance of electrostatic MEMS devices. For example, sulfur dioxide is one gas that has been identified as suitable for this application. The result of utilizing this technique is the realization of an equivalent performance MEMS device that can be smaller, lower voltage and/or more powerful than the same device packaged in a vacuum or a traditional gas chemistry. MEMS gyroscopic sensors are particularly well suited to take advantage of this technology, due to the sensor's architecture where both electrostatic actuation and capacitive sensing are employed, and because of the large, but cost sensitive commercial market potential, which includes inertial sensing, automotive safety, the Segway Human Transporter and similar systems, and camcorder and digital camera image stabilization. If successful one of the outcomes of this effort will be an increased knowledgebase of the fluidic damping, dielectric breakdown, and relative permittivity voltage magnitude/frequency dependence properties of various gas chemistries that have not heretofore been investigated in this type of application. This should lead to new MEMS products, the application of existing MEMS products to new applications, and an enhanced understanding of the capabilities and limitations of micromachined devices."

IGCC has many advantages over traditional technologies including higher efficiency, lower pollutant emissions, and a possibility of carbon capture and sequestration.  One of the remaining challenges for the IGCC is the need to develop a cleanup technology to remove reduced sulfur and nitrogen compounds from the hot fuel gas at gasification operating temperatures.
   NanoScale Materials, Inc. proposes development of nanocrystalline sorbent and catalysts for hot gas cleanup technology to allow for removal of reduced sulfur (H2S and COS) and nitrogen (NH3 and HCN) pollutants from coal-generated fuel gases at gasification operating temperatures.  The proposed project has a potential to revolutionize current methods by providing sorbent and catalyst materials that are technically superior to existing materials.  Possible applications of the proposed technology include IGCC plants and other pollution control systems.  Benefits offered by nanocrystalline sorbents, including enhanced chemical kinetics and increased removal capacities, have been demonstrated for many toxic chemicals and pollutants.  Similar effects are expected for removal of sulfur and nitrogen compounds.  Equally important, the approach proposed by NanoScale utilizes manufacturing methods that are easily scalable, cost-efficient, and environmentally friendly.
   In the proposed project, pollutant removal capacities of various materials will be evaluated experimentally using a gas mixture that realistically resembles real fuel gas composition.  The testing will include both laboratory scale experiments, as well as pilot-scale demonstrations in real fuel gas conditions at the Western Research Institute.  Sorbents and catalysts will be tailored to selectively react with reduced sulfur and nitrogen compounds present in fuel gas but will be immune to other components of the fuel gas.  It is anticipated that the results of the proposed project will clearly demonstrate the advantage of using nanocrystalline materials for hot fuel gas cleanup and the feasibility of the NanoScale approach.  In addition, the most promising sorbents and catalysts will be identified allowing for their further development and optimization in the Phase II effort.

A key barrier is that expression vectors undergo promoter inactivation (silencing) over time. This lack of sustained transgene expression negatively impacts the cost of cell culture production of recombinant proteins, and has limited the application of non-viral vector systems to short term applications. Here we propose to create enabling technology to improve the duration of expression from non-viral vectors in mammalian cells by developing novel eukaryotic expression vectors resistant to transgene silencing. These studies will utilize a eukaryotic expression vector backbone developed at NTC, containing a chimeric SV40-CMV promoter, which improves expression levels 10 fold over alternative CMV promoter vectors. We propose to further improve these vectors through evaluation of two methodologies to prevent transgene silencing. First, we hypothesize that transcription of the prokaryotic region will disrupt heterochromatin formation, and improve episomal or integrated cell line expression. We will transcribe the region of the plasmid that promotes heterochromatin formation using promoters integrated into the vector backbone. Second, we hypothesize that one or more structured regions within the replication origin form unusual structures that recruits heterochromatin and accounts for the silencing. High yield minimal origin constructs, that eliminate these putative heterochromatin inducing regions, will be constructed. The vectors will be tested in integrated and transiently transfected cell lines for improved performance. The overall goal of this feasibility study is to determine whether either strategy represents a significant advantage over alternate approaches to prevent transgene silencing, such as minicircle or matrix attached region (MAR) vectors. This technology, combined with the optimized NTC expression vectors, should enable NTC to create next generation expression systems for low cost production of cell culture derived recombinant proteins. In Phase II, NTC will make the vectors available for licensing, and will apply the technology to develop cell culture based methods for manufacture of glycoproteins such as FSH and biogeneric drugs."

The overall goal of this project is to develop a rapid deployment DNA vaccine platform protective against pandemic influenza H5N1. The hypothesis is that influenza DNA vaccine potency can be increased through activation of cytoplasmic double stranded RNA (dsRNA) signaling pathways by vector encoded immunostimulatory RNA. This will be accomplished through the use of various immunostimulatory ""RNA elements"" (RNAe). This Phase I proof of concept study will investigate the potential benefit of inclusion of vector-mediated RNAe on immune responses to an vector encoded target antigen. Influenza Hemagglutinin (HA) will be used as an example antigen requiring antibody responses for protection. Novel HA DNA vaccine plasmid vectors that produce immunostimulatory dsRNA will be created and screened for immune response in vivo after delivery by electroporation-enhanced intramuscular injection. The optimal backbone that improves neutralizing antibody response to HA will be selected. Then, building upon this RNAe vector, 'inhibiting-the-inhibitor' DNA vaccines will be created and tested in a subordinate study. The secondary hypothesis is that immune responses induced by the dsRNA activating DNA vaccines can be further improved by preventing target cell downregulation of immune responses mediated by vector activation of innate immunity. The vectors defined above will be further modified to incorporate RNAe which knockdown expression of various attenuators of these cytoplasmic dsRNA signaling pathways. Antibody responses to HA induced by the 'inhibiting-the- inhibitor' DNA vaccines will then be determined in an animal model. In Phase II the resulting optimal vector backbone (i.e., specific immunostimulatory RNAe alone, or potentially in combination with 'inhibiting the inhibitor' shRNA as determined herein) will be developed as a novel, rapid deployment DNA-only vaccine platform for influenza H5N1. The rapid deployment DNA vaccine platform developed herein will have general utility with a variety of other emerging biological agents; NTC will license the platform for such applications. This proposal is aimed at developing novel influenza vaccines to replace egg based vaccine production technologies and as such is responsive to NIAID's high priority influenza research areas, as outlined in NOT-AI-06-011."

Technological innovations include biosensor design, turnkey head mount design, advanced electronics design, and advanced low power radio frequency design. The ability to measure glucose from specific brain areas in vivo while simultaneously recording sleep in rodents will give researchers the ability to better examine the functioning of specific sites within the brain during the sleep process as well as leverage the advantages conferred by using rat and mouse models for research. The ability to instantly record glucose levels in a sleeping and awake mouse or rat, and correlate that activity with EEG/EMG, will be valuable to researchers studying sleep and metabolism. The investigation of glucose in a mouse model will open up new avenues of research with genetic mutations available in species such as the NIRKO mouse (brain/neuron-specific insulin receptor knockout) which may have altered glucose responses during sleep and provide clues as to how sleep and metabolism are linked. At least 40 million Americans suffer each year from chronic, long-term sleep disorders and an additional 20 million experience occasional sleeping problems.

While these diseases originally gained attention as food-borne illnesses, it has become apparent that blood and blood-products may also transmit disease.  This observation is of further concern as definitive diagnosis of TSEs relies upon post-mortem diagnostics.  Ideal assays would identify the earliest stages of disease based on easily-available samples, such as blood.  RTI has extensive experience in the use of animal models in biological research, and an established interest in the development of diagnostic tests for prion diseases.  Our Phase I efforts have utilized advanced proteomics techniques to isolate proteins specifically altered during TSE pathogenesis in an animal model.  Further, we have developed an in vitro cell-culture model of scrapie infection which can be used to define proteins of interest in TSE diagnosis.  We propose to  capitalize on our previous expertise in the development of monoclonal-antibody based diagnostics to specifically develop a multiplexed protein-based assay for prion disease in animals, and apply that knowledge to parallel development of blood-based diagnostics for human prion diseases."

(SDHTI) proposes a computer-based training program called HAZMAT Training for First Responders in Rural Areas: an Online Intelligent Tutoring System as one solution to the problem. SDHTI's experienced team of software designers will design, develop, and evaluate the program utilizing an advisory panel made up of a variety of experts and workers from within the EMS field.        A clear research objective has been identified. Determine the effectiveness of an inquiry based instructional module that-through virtual HAZMAT event scenarios-equips first responders in rural areas with the knowledge and skills necessary to respond to real HAZMAT bioterrorism events relevant to rural EMS. The ADDIE (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate) model will govern the overall design process. A ""backward design"" process will also be used in identifying the content scope,    determining training assessments, and orchestrating learning experiences necessary to    adequately train and maintain a proficient first responder pool.

The specificity that a number of these novel non-nitrogen- containing bisphosphonates, most notably LWS-138, exhibit over the leading commercial alternatives makes them favorable candidates for further development aimed at clinical usage. Phase One of this project contains four specific aims designed to prove feasibility of this premise. These aims are formulated to allow a go/no-go decision on each of three potential lead compounds we have identified in our preliminary work. We plan to make enough of each member of our lead series for these studies (4-5 grams). We will concurrently carry out method development and validation for quantitative determination of each of these candidates in cell culture media, cell lysate, and mouse plasma. The primary feasibility studies will entail a combination of in vitro pharmacokinetic studies of metabolism, membrane permeability, and plasma protein binding; and in vivo efficacy studies in mouse xenograft breast and prostate cancer models. From these studies we will prioritize the compounds for further study in more elaborate models of metastatic bone disease as part of a Phase Two proposal. It was estimated that there would be approximately 500,000 new diagnoses of cancers of the breast, prostate or multiple myeloma in 2005, and that deaths from these cancers in that year would reach a total of 82,000. Nearly all of the patients who are somewhere between these two points in the disease progression will present with metastatic bone disease at some time. Metastatic disease confined to the skeleton is associated with a longer life expectancy than visceral metastasis but also with significant morbidity; therefore new therapies which could lessen the morbidity in this large group of patients would clearly benefit the public."

In dogs, DM is characterized by the rapid onset of bilateral sugar cataracts which often result in vision loss. Today, nearly one in three 3 dogs with cataracts is diabetic. Sugar cataracts cannot be currently prevented and surgery is the only treatment available. The $2,500 - $5,000 cost for this surgery, however, can be prohibitive because it is not covered by most insurance policies. To address the significant need for an alternate treatment for sugar cataracts, this proposal seeks to develop a topical aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) formulation, Kinostat, for the veterinary market. Studies have established that aldose reductase initiates sugar cataracts in both diabetic and galactosemic animals and that ARIs prevent sugar cataract formation in both of these animal models. Based on prevention studies in dogs that report that oral administration of ARIs reduce sugar cataract formation in a dose-dependent manner, we have demonstrated in preliminary results that topical Kinostat treatment of galactose-fed beagles with cortical sugar cataracts not only arrests cataract development, but actually partially reverses early sugar cataracts. This indicates that Kinostat not only may serve as a prophylactic treatment against the formation of cataracts but that it can restore functional vision in the dogs with early sugar cataracts, thus reducing the need for surgery in the growing population dogs with DM . Based on these results, the specific aim of Phase I of this proposal is to conduct a 12-month pilot clinical trial with 30 ""volunteer"" dogs of various breeds with DM to demonstrate that topical Kinostat can inhibit sugar cataract formation and as a result maintain functional vision in diabetic dogs. Lens changes will be documented by retroillumination photography and the extent of opacification in these images will be quantified by computer image analysis. The successful demonstration of Kinostat efficacy in Phase I of this study will be followed in Phase II by a multi-center, masked clinical trial in which Kinostat or placebo will be administered to diabetic dogs with little or no lens changes and no overt cortical or nuclear opacities. Following the demonstration of efficacy in Phase II for successfully inhibiting or significantly delaying the onset and progression of sugar cataracts, Kinostat will be marketed for veterinary use. The availability of a topical inhibitor of sugar cataracts could benefit an estimated 400,000 companion dogs in the United States by reducing the need for cataract surgery. This proposal seeks to develop a topical drug, Kinostat, for the prevention/treatment of sugar cataracts in dogs with diabetes mellitus (DM). Based on preliminary results where Kinostat not only served as a prophylactic treatment against the formation of sugar cataracts but also restored functional vision in galactose-fed dogs with early sugar cataracts, the specific aim of this proposal is to conduct a 12-month pilot trial with 30 ""volunteer"" dogs of various breeds with DM. The successful demonstration in this Phase I study that topical Kinostat inhibits sugar cataract formation and maintains functional vision in dogs with DM so that the need for cataract surgery is reduced, will be followed in Phase II by a multi-center, masked clinical trial with our ultimate goal being the marketing of Kinostat for veterinary use so that the need for surgery is aleviated in an estimated 400,000 diabetic companion dogs that develop DM in the United States."

The proposed instrument seeks to satisfy the ITRS requirements on two counts: 1. full flow inspection, and 2. detection of sub-100nm liquid-borne particles. 1. A typical semiconductor fab uses about 3 million gallons of UPW every day, and the ITRS, in its attempt to conserve the precious resource, water, mandates that 90% of UPW be recycled/reused by 2010. The recycled UPW loop will need full flow monitoring, which the proposed Particle Scout will do. 2. The purity of UPW directly affects the chip yield, because the final operation on wafers is UPW rinse and any contaminants present in the UPW contaminate the wafers it rinses. As the industry moves to sub-100 nm nodes the ITRS particle detection requirements fall to sub-50 nm. Particle Scout for monitoring in real-time the particulate purity of recycled UPW for use in Semiconductor processing successfully overcomes a critical technological barrier facing the IC manufacturing

Thus, it is not possible to make the cancer diagnosis until rapid nodule growth is observed in subsequent follow up scans. This problem of finding nodules but delaying diagnosis and therapy is known as the lung cancer paradox. To assist in early lung-cancer detection, we propose a catheter-based system that can be accurately positioned inside the lung for traditional biopsy or optical sampling. In phase I, we will design a combined hardware and software system for planning a diagnostic procedure and guiding a catheter toward the precise region of interest using a magnetically-tracked sensor and a 3D model of the pulmonary anatomy derived from CT imaging. Also in phase I, we will begin to implement optical tracking of the endoscope tip as the foundation for our phase II hybrid system which will combine both magnetic and optical tracking into a single navigational tool. In this Phase I feasibility project, we propose four specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Refine the algorithms needed for the magnetic tracking of a bronchoscope tip during an endoscopic procedure. In particular, the phase one work includes refining the algorithms for: A. Visualization: Our navigational software's current graphical software displays a 3D model of a patient's airway created from CT-image data. In phase I, we will develop algorithms to include the patient's vascular tree in the visualization software. B. Registration: We will refine our current fiduciary point based registration to an easier to use touchless calibration process. Specific Aim 2: We will develop algorithms that limit error in reporting the bronchoscope's position due to patient respiratory motion. Specific Aim 3: We will develop algorithms to register endoscopic video to the patient's virtual 3D airway model, providing the foundation for our phase II hybrid system which will integrate magnetic and optical tracking. Specific Aim 4: Validate the system's ability to locate an airway target with less than a 5.0 mm mean error in position in a breathing lung, our phase one goal for accuracy. We will also measure how well the optical matching will improve the system's tracking accuracy. We will evaluate positioning accuracy of the magnetic tracking in an animal model as well as the positioning accuracy of our initial optical tracking algorithms. In the phase II work, we will develop a hybrid magneto-optical tracking technique that uses the bronchoscopic video to provide real time additional positioning accuracy and increased robustness in the presence of patient motion. This system will provide a unique platform to facilitate bronchoscopically-delivered procedures such as biopsy and non-surgical interventions for lung disease. Advances in novel, non-surgical therapies for lung disease make it critical to accurately target regions of interest and guide catheters and other devices into position for therapy. This project will combine a bronchoscope, magnetic position sensor, and a high resolution model of the thoracic anatomy into a pulmonary intervention workstation. Physicians can use this system to identify and quantify disease and regions of interest, plan in- terventions and other procedures, and precisely navigate toward regions of interest to obtain biopsies and/or deliver therapy."

Identification of the lung lobes is essential, not only so that quantitative measures can be reported on a lobe-by-lobe basis, but also to design and plan interventions targeted toward a specific lung region. Importantly, approximately 25% of pulmonary CT-images show incomplete lobar tissues and therefore there may exist inter-lobar communication to adversely affect therapy. Accurate identification of the lobar tissues, in both the complete and the incomplete cases, is urgently needed for quantitative lung analysis. The technology development research proposed below is motivated by the following overriding hypothesis: Our novel tissue detection will provide accurate and robust assessment of pulmonary lobes in 3-D, even in the presence of parenchymal disease or anatomical abnormality causing incomplete or disintegrating tissues. The Phase-I feasibility proposal presented here has the following specific aims: 1. Develop a method for automated accurate identification of lobar tissue surfaces in volumetric high- resolution MDCT images. 2. Develop a method for identification and quantitative assessment of incomplete and/or disintegrating fissures. 3. Demonstrate feasibility of the developed lobar segmentation method in subjects with pathologies causing tissue disintegration such as emphysema. As part of the Phase I proposal, we will demonstrate that identification (segmentation) of lobar tissue surfaces can be accomplished with high accuracy in complete tissues. We will also demonstrate that the accuracy in incomplete tissues can be accomplished with a positioning error that is comparable to an inter-observer variability of expert observers performing the same task. Once feasibility of the proposed quantification is proven, Phase II will concentrate on development and validation of a comprehensive software tool for assessment of lobar morphology, volumetric characterization, collateral cross-lobar ventilation and perfusion, and identification of airways and vessels connecting the neighboring lobes in lungs with incomplete tissues. Advances in medical imaging and novel, non-surgical therapies for lung disease make it critical to accurately identify and describe lung anatomy. Identification of the lung lobes is essential, not only to the compartmentalization of quantitative measures used to phenotype pathology and to follow changes in pathology, but also to design interventions seeking to eliminate ventilation to a targeted lung region. In the approximately 25% of CT-imaged patients with incomplete tissues, area of tissue incompleteness and the level of inter-lobar communication must be determined since it affects lobar-based analysis as well as the outcomes of interventional treatment. No such methods are currently available. In this project we will develop methods to identify the five lobes of the human lung in CT images, including subjects with incomplete tissue anatomy. This will make it possible to measure and study disease on a regional lobe-by-lobe basis. The proposed methods are urgently needed to take advantage of emerging therapies for the early treatment of lung disease."

  coal to fuel gas, and then uses combined cycle power block to generate electricity,

  is one of the most promising technologies to meet the challenge of generating

  electricity from coal in an environmentally sustainable way.  IGCC has

  many advantages over traditional technologies, including:  higher efficiency,

  lower pollutant emissions, and a possibility of carbon capture and sequestration.  One

  of the remaining challenges for the IGCC is the need to develop a cleanup technology

  to remove reduced sulfur and nitrogen compounds from the hot fuel gas at gasification

  operating temperatures.

NanoScale Materials, Inc. proposes development of nanocrystalline sorbents

  and catalysts for hot gas cleanup technology to allow for removal of reduced

  sulfur (H2S and COS) and nitrogen (NH3 and HCN) pollutants from coal-generated

  fuel gases at gasification operating temperatures.  This project has a

  potential to revolutionize current control methods by providing sorbent and

  catalyst materials that are technically superior to existing materials.  Possible

  applications of the proposed technology include IGCC plants and other pollution

  control systems.  Benefits offered by nanocrystalline sorbents, including

  enhanced chemical kinetics and increased removal capacities, have been demonstrated

  for many toxic chemicals and pollutants.  Similar effects are expected

  for removal of sulfur and nitrogen compounds.  The approach proposed by

  NanoScale utilizes manufacturing methods that are easily scalable, cost efficient,

  and environmentally friendly.

In this project, pollutant removal capacities of various materials will be

  evaluated experimentally using a gas mixture that realistically resembles real

  fuel gas composition.  The testing will include both laboratory-scale

  experiments, as well as pilot-scale demonstrations, in real fuel gas conditions

  at the Western Research Institute.  Sorbents and catalysts will be tailored

  to selectively react with reduced sulfur and nitrogen compounds present in

  fuel gas but will be immune to other components of the fuel gas.  It is

  anticipated that the results of this project will clearly demonstrate the advantage

Initial demonstration measurements will be performed in cold and heated air flows using PIV and acetone/biacetyl PLIF at 1 kHz, with the goal of capturing coherent structure dynamics and understanding their role in affecting combustion stability in augmentor flows. Extension of such measurements to higher repetition rates and for species such as the hydroxyl radical (OH) will also be evaluated.   This research effort will be used to design a second generation system for application of high-speed PIV and PLIF of fuel and OH in a realistic augmentor test rig during the Phase-II period.

The control included successful noise mitigation in a Mach 0.9 jet and mixing enhancement (and very preliminary results for noise mitigation) in a Mach 1.3 ideally expanded jet. The control relies on high bandwidth of the actuators and excites various instabilities in the jet to achieve the goal of mixing enhancement or noise mitigation. The proposed Phase I work will explore the effectiveness of this technology in more practical supersonic exhaust jets operating with various flow regimes (i.e. ideally-, over-, and under-expanded) and high temperature.

Moreover, large wind tunnel facilities suffer the difficulty that particle seeding is problematic for techniques such as Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV).  The opportunity addressed by this proposal is that of extending a focused Schlieren “PIV” technique for high-speed imaging of density gradients and seedless velocimetry for studies of high-frequency flow control.  Sharp-focusing optics will be employed to demonstrate the feasibility of achieving near-planar imaging of density gradients and velocity.  Another important challenge that will be addressed in the current work is the extension of Schlieren “PIV” to non-turbulent freestream flows away from wall boundary layers and shear layers.  This may be accomplished by combining Schlieren “PIV” with techniques such as jet injection or laser-energy deposition.  Alternatively, plasma actuation for flow control would naturally lead to local density gradients that could be tracked using the proposed approach.  Proof-of-concept shakedown tests will be performed in an axisymmetric helium jet and on the center-plane of a supersonic wind tunnel facility in preparation for studies of high-frequency actuation in Phase II."

Thin plastic films (typically polyethylene) are spread along the rows of plants at the beginning of the growing season. Holes are made in the films to plant the seeds or seedlings. The use of mulch films speeds the ripening of crops, conserves moisture and fertilizer, and inhibits weed growth, fungus infection and insect infestation. At the end of the growing season (generally 3-5 months) the film, contaminated with dirt and vegetation, must be collected, transported and disposed. As the use of mulching films becomes more common, the disposal of the polyethylene film becomes a significant waste problem. The Phase I R&D project determined that a degradable agricultural mulch film from a poly(lactic acid)/starch blend could be produced and mechanical and exterior exposure field tests were conducted. The Phase II research program will focus on moving the polymer blending process to full-scale manufacturing equipment and procedures, optimizing the film manufacturing parameters and conduct large scale product field testing. Film product will be produced on a full-scale manufacturing line and the film tested for initial and aged mechanical properties, soil plot field application and exterior exposure performance. The development of a truly degradable mulching film will reduce labor and disposal costs for agricultural producers. The PLA/starch polymeric blend utilizes 99% biobased materials and its use will displace petroleum derived polyethylene mulch films."

Swine breeders need a genetic selection tool to help reverse this trend. The purpose of this project is to build on several years of research experience with ultrasound and prediction of IMF for live beef cattle by applying the technology to live swine. Phase I involves serially scanning 400 live animals to develop mathematical models to characterize the IMF in pork samples from each pig. A database of image texture parameters that are predictive of IMF will be developed. Pigs will be harvested, visual marbling scores will be obtained at the packing plant, tissue samples will be taken at the scanning site, and a slice of the longissimus muscle from the 10th to 11th rib interface will be transported to a meat laboratory for chemical analysis. Linear and nonlinear IMF prediction models will be developed using the image texture parameters as the dependent variables and the tissue IMF (chemical fat) as the independent variable. Phase I will prove the ability to enhance IMF prediction accuracy using ultrasound in live pigs by a minimum of 10 percent over the current published research. In addition, Phase I will demonstrate the ability to port an IMF prediction model from one ultrasound equipment type to another with an incremental standard error of prediction of less than 0.25% IMF."

The broad, long-term objectives of this Phase I STTR proposal is to demonstrate feasibility in developing a novel optical-electronic biosensor for microscopic applications to permit simultaneous integration of photonic and electronic signals for comprehensive time-lapsed microscopy applications. Optical microscopy has limitations in sensitivity to evaluate the impact of signal transduction on cell-membrane function. Light microscopy is unable to detect cell-membrane displacement at the low nanometer level, and its specificity is limited by the potential over-interpretation of observed microscopic changes at the micron level. Thus, optical signals need to be properly interpreted within the contexts of an independent method. In contrast, electronic sensors have the resolution to measure cell surface cell membrane function at the low nanometer level but have limited intracellular spatial resolution. In collaboration with Iowa State University, CET Inc. will develop a novel, optical-electronic biosensor that will measure several functional parameters in cultured cells in a nondestructive fashion with a resolution of transmission electron microscopy. This sensor will combine the complementary strengths of electronic and optical signals. The outcome of this research is to demonstrate feasibility that will leverage a Phase II proposal that leads to further developments in sensor design, software and hardware development and image analysis and signal processing to provide comprehensive information on signal transduction in cultured living cells. The commercial product will provide a comprehensive platform for cell microscopists. The specific objectives for Phase I of this STTR are: (1) fabricate an optical-electronic sensor that can quantitatively and dynamically measure cell adhesion and motility without electrode signal degradation; (2) experimentally validate that the sensor is not inherently toxic to cells over both short and long time periods; (3) validate that the sensor does not impede the photonic signals from phase, DIC, and fluorescent microscopy."

ITSs have proven to be highly effective in delivering computer-based instruction, but they have historically been expensive and difficult to build, requiring specialized skill in artificial intelligence and production systems programming. Building upon Clearsighted's Phase I accomplishments, the firm will: (1) finish a fully-functional software development kit (SDK) that will allow non-cognitive scientists to create the cognitive model that powers an ITS; (2) develop technology that will enable an ITS to communicate to the vast majority of third-party software; (3) develop techniques that will allow an ITS to work with an institution's existing on-line learning system; and (4) evaluate the research team's work with respect to both time-savings in building ITSs and customers' return on investment. Two main results are anticipated: (1) a two- to three-fold decrease in the amount of time it takes to author an ITS; and (2) an estimated savings to customers of 30% per hour of the cost of traditional training time. The success of ITSs is well documented (e.g., Koedinger, Anderson, Hadley, & Mark, 1997; Corbett, 2001; Morgan & Ritter, 2002). However, ITSs have not been broadly deployed, due to the high level of expertise needed and the cost to create. Furthermore, lack of viable options to interface the cognitive model of an ITS with already existing software impairs wider dissemination of that technology. By increasing technological understanding of how to reduce the amount of the expertise needed to create an ITS and how to accomplish interfacing ITSs with existing software, the result of this supported work will be a wider distribution of ITSs. Clearsighted is well poised to become a market leader in on-line technical training by leveraging this technology. Clearsighted has partnered with Carnegie Learning, the ITS leader in K-12 education to assist in these goals, and it has the additional expertise needed to perform the required work. By transitioning ITS technology from its currently very small market to a wider audience that includes not only education, but also corporate and industrial applications, the costs to the many companies and institutions that do on-line training will greatly decrease, and the productivity of their workers will increase."

The design strategy draws from diverse groups including 1) advisory boards of children and parents; 2) physical science experts; 3) learning and health behavior experts; and 4) a creative and technically proficient team of game developers. The inclusion of children, parents, educators and health professionals insures that end users of the game are involved in the game design from the beginning of the project. The PAC will be adapted from existing and emerging game control technology. Phase I will develop the fundamental concepts for the PAC and the game design that integrates physical activity into game play. Phase I will produce a prototype of the game and of the PAC. Feasibility evaluation includes formative and summative assessment 1) of the game concepts, 2) of the prototype videogame's appeal to children; and 3) of physical activity during prototype game play. The project leverages experience and knowledge gained from developing previous learning video games, including an SBIR video game project. The physical activity game will extend the innovative use of compelling video gaming to help children choose physically active entertainment over sedentary activities, thereby improving public health by reducing the risk and negative effects of chronic diseases including cancer.

The IM programs will be field tested with adolescents with a history of social problems. A pretest-posttest control-group design will be used in each field test, with each field test focusing on one program. The effectiveness of each program will be evaluated relative to: (a) youth use of the IM program, (b) youth knowledge of the social skills, (c) youth use of the social skills, (d) adult perception of student use of the social skills in the natural environment, (e) judges' ratings of youth use of the social skills in role-play performances, (f) disciplinary offenses committed by the youths, (g) social validity of the medium, and (h) required instructional time. This project is relevant to public health because the number of youths with social problems is substantial. Their problems are common, persistent, often escalate from minor conduct problems to criminal offenses, are resistant to change, and are associated with poor psychological and emotional adjustment later in life. The empirically validated IM products that will result from this project will address the potentially devastating effects that social maladjustment can cause in children's lives and in society at large. Since social conduct problems are highly correlated with future criminal activity (Loeber & Farrington, 1998), an important goal for our society is the instruction of appropriate social behavior, especially with those children who have been identified as having behavior problems. The training would be used to prevent social isolation, address antisocial behavior, and provide youth with alternatives to the behaviors that result in formal and informal reprimands from authority. The instructional modules that will result from this project will be usable as prevention or intervention programs based on individual needs. In addition, the proposed programs will serve as a model for the development of future IM programs for youths."

Once revisions are completed, full-blown field tests for each IM program will be completed with approximately 120 middle and high school students with HID. The feasibility and validation studies will focus on (a) usability of the program, (b) student knowledge of the content and skills, (c) student use of the content and skills, (d) social validity of the program, and (e) social validity of the model. This project is relevant to public health because the number of individuals with low literacy skills is substantial. Particularly, many students with high incidence disabilities struggle with various aspects of reading and literacy-related skills. A large number of these students will either drop-out of school or continue to struggle throughout their school careers and into adulthood. Low literacy has been associated with such poor adult outcomes as under- and unemployment, increased criminal activity, and poverty. The empirically validated IM products that will result from this project will address the potentially devastating effects that low literacy can cause in children's lives and in society at large. Since vocabulary development is seen as a bridge between emerging reading skills and comprehension, this project has the potential to help many students expand their literacy skills. The instruction would be used to help them learn common words parts, independently remember meanings of new words, and expand their use of new words, and apply their skills to hundreds of new high-frequency, high-utility words. The instructional programs that will result from this project will be usable as literacy intervention programs based on individual needs. In addition, the proposed programs will serve as a model for the development of future IM programs for individuals with high incidence disabilities."

RNA interference (RNAi) is the property of small (20 to 23 bases) RNA sequences that with the help of the RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) enable the catalytic cleavage of target RNA sequences and the knockdown of the expression level of the target gene. The steps involved in loading and associating an RNAi sequences into an active RISC are several in addition to the multi-factorial variation in biochemical activities of RNAi sequences once in an active RISC. Finding the relevant biochemical features that associate with these quantifiable measures of RNAi can allow i) better predictive models of RNAi and RNAi-like (e.g. microRNAs) activities and ii) a better understanding of the relevant biochemical properties since presumably less relevant properties should not increase the predictive abilities of models containing those properties. We have developed a novel feature mapping method, referred to as Binary Base mapping, that improves the ability of a SVM to predict RNAi activities when compared to two previous methods, refered to as Unit Vector and N-gram mapping. Alone, the Binary Base SVM method has greater predictive accuracy than a recently published neural network machine learning method, on the same training and testing data. Several additional mapping methods can be envisioned, including methods that incorporate RNAi thermodynamics, secondary structure or measures of entropy, and whether alone or in combination these mappings of sequence to vector space for SVM model construction lead to better predictive models or understanding of RNAi biochemistry is unknown. We are requesting funding for the specific aims of: i) testing whether the Binary Base method can be used to further dissect and identify relevant biochemical feature associated with RNAi activity, ii) analyzing what additional vector mapping methods lead to predictive models with increased accuracy or greater understanding of relevant biochemical properties, and iii) investigating the distribution of sites within and among target mRNA genes where predictive SVM models identify high versus low activity. Title Support vector machines predict sequence ~ activity relationships in RNA interference Project Narrative Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have regulatory influence in human development and disease and better understanding how these molecules function involves the development of predictive models. Machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are one way to develop predictive models for these small RNA sequences and the incorporation of novel mapping methods in SVMs leads to model improvement. Finding and combining additional sequence mapping methods can lead to better predictive models for RNA interference activity as well as related processes such as microRNA activity, chemical modification of RNAi and RNAi stability or RNAi toxicity; further improving the understanding of how scnRNAs function and how they might be regulated."

DO sensors are a primary tool for gauging the quality of both fresh water (rivers, lakes, reservoirs) and the oceans; for monitoring the various processes in waste water treatment plants; and,  for monitoring fermentation processes in the food and beverage industries. Unfortunately, electrochemical sensors are slow (response time >1 min), short-lived (a few days), and expensive (~$500).  The proposed DO sensor is based on a new platform of structurally integrated photoluminescence (PL)-based chemical and biological sensors.  In this platform, the pulsed light source that excites the PL is an array of individually addressable ~100 um2 to ~1 cm2 organic light-emitting device (OLED) pixels. The small pixels will eventually enable development of microsensor arrays.  The ~0.5 um-thick pixel array and ~1 um-thick sensor film will be fabricated on opposite sides of a glass or plastic substrate, or on two substrates attached back-to-back.  The Si photodiode will be ""behind"" the OLED array, monitoring the PL passing between the OLED pixels.  This uniquely simple structurally integrated platform should ultimately yield multianalyte chemical and biological microsensor arrays for a wide variety of agents. If successful the proposed device will be uniquely simple, initially palm-size and eventually microsize, autonomous, fast (~1 sec response), miserly on power consumption, and inexpensive (ultimately with an essentially disposable OLED/sensor film module).  It will operate in the PL-lifetime mode, eliminating the need for frequent calibration.  It will consequently replace the short-lived electrochemical sensors and the expensive PL-based DO sensors that currently serve the diverse markets listed above.  The proposed development of the DO microsensor will demonstrate the viability of the new OLED-based sensor platform, leading the way towards the development of multianalyte chemical and biological microsensor arrays for gas and liquid phases.  This development will enhance scientific and technological needs in the field of sensor technology by addressing current issues of sensor size, cost, analyte sampling, and field deployability."

This project will develop a tunable diode laser-based open-path methane analyzer using newly-developed laser technology.  The new analyzer will be suitable for deployment over a wide range of ecosystems to understand methane exchange between the atmosphere and the surface.  In Phase I, an open-path methane analyzer, with a newly available vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) and wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS), was developed.  The resolution of the analyzer was shown to be better than 10 ppb at a 10-Hz sampling rate, exceeding the required specifications for methane flux measurement; therefore, even low methane fluxes can be measured using eddy covariance with this instrument.   Phase II will further develop the open-path methane analyzer by adding a multiple-pass Herriott optical cell to the VCSEL and WMS.  Instrument-embedded software and application software also will be developed.  The analyzer will be capable of field deployment for methane flux measurement over various ecosystems and other surface contexts (e.g. landfills and animal husbandry lots).   Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The lack of robust and reliable methane analyzers has limited observations of methane exchange, between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, to short-time intervals only.

However, many proteins of great commercial value, including enzymes, undergo loss of function on encapsulation, when approaches based on high-shear liquid-phase processes, or on immobilization inside a porous matrix, are used.  This project will develop a gentle method, based on a nano-engineering approach, for encapsulating proteins and protein complexes.  The resulting product would allow, for example, enzyme catalysis to be carried out at room temperature, providing significant energy savings over competing products.  Phase I demonstrated that protein solutions could be encapsulated into true core-shell structures and that the technology would facilitate:  (1) the reuse of enzyme catalysts for energy-efficient processes, and (2) the design of efficient protein drug delivery systems.  In Phase II, pilot-scale quantities of encapsulated enzyme catalysts and one protein-based drug ¿ namely, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-a) ¿ will be produced, and further testing will be conducted.  Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  There are two primary applications for the technology.  The first involves enzyme catalyst recovery, which is essential for the commercialization of certain chemical reaction processes.  Some enzymes cannot be immobilized onto the surface of a carrier particle without loss of catalytic function.  The encapsulation of  enzymes within  a porous shell would overcomes this obstacle.  The second application involves the use of proteins for the treatment of certain types of cancer.  Some of these proteins are toxic when administered systemically in therapeutic amounts.

The treatment cost for patients suffering from these conditions are massive with an estimated annual economic cost of $65 billion in the US alone. Magnetic resonance imaging facilitates non-invasive imaging of articular cartilage in vivo. However, manual analysis is tedious, inaccurate, and irreproducible and no computer- aided tool is commercially available to analyze high-resolution 3-D MR cartilage image data. This proposal is for development of quantitative analysis of articular cartilage morphology and tissue composition in highly congruent joints (knee, ankle) from anatomical and multi-contrast 3-D magnetic resonance images. The main innovation of the proposed approach is that the multiple surfaces of adjoining bones and cartilages in the entire joint will be segmented simultaneously in 3-D rather than independently border-by-border and slice-by-slice in 2-D, thus taking advantage of 3-D contextual information with an expected improvement in 3-D segmentation performance. Multi-contrast MR tissue characterization will identify 6 cartilage tissue types in a volumetric fashion. The specific aims of this Phase-I proposal are to: 1) Develop a method for comprehensive morphometric analysis of articular cartilage over the complete joint surface from volumetric high-resolution MR images. 2) Develop a method for cartilage tissue characterization from volumetric multi-contrast MR images. 3) Develop a prototype Cartilage Analyzer software suite and assess its performance in human cadaver and in vivo ankles and knees. The overarching goal of the Phase II research is to build and validate a prototype system for quantitative cartilage analysis that will be utilized by orthopedic clinicians treating osteoarthritis, orthopedic surgeons, musculoskeletal radiologists, and researchers for epidemiologic and pharmacologic studies, as well as by MR scanner manufacturers.

Current decontaminants include powdered sorbents that leave residues that impair the performance of sensitive equipment such as optics and electronics.  A decontamination wipe that leaves no residue is required. NanoScale Materials, Inc. (NanoScale®) proposes development of decontaminant wipes in which its proprietary sorbent, NanoActive® TiO2, is contained within fabrics that do not release particulates.  In this way the strong ability of NanoActive TiO2 to destructively adsorb CWAs can be utilized in a way that leaves no residue. In Phase I, NanoScale will evaluate the properties of fabrics to determine which best transfer CWA simulants from contaminated surfaces to NanoActive TiO2.  The tendency of these fabrics to leave residues and scratches on surfaces will be determined.  Prototype decontamination wipes will be constructed, and the wipes will be tested for ability to decontaminate surfaces without damage to materials or transferring contamination to other surfaces. NanoScale is a leader in first-response decontamination of CWAs and other toxic compounds.  NanoActive TiO2 has demonstrated excellent capacity to permanently destroy CWAs, their simulants, and other hazardous materials."

NanoScale's long term goal is to utilze this novel material in advanced lithium ion batteries to be used in biomedical devices such as implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICD). While metal oxide based lithium batteries are now established as one of the major power sources for the biomedical technological developments, low electrochemical outputs are commonly encountered because of poor lithium ion mobility and structural damage due to repeating intercalation of Li ion into oxide host matrices. Nanomaterials with specific high surface area and high porosity are highly desirable and extremely attractive in the development of new multifunctional devices for electrochemical storage technology. By using nanomaterials, advanced lithium ion batteries can deliver higher capacity and higher charge/discharge rate in comparison to the battery made with conventional materials while maintaining structural motif. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach, the research will be divided into four major tasks: (1) Preparation of a high surface area nano-LiMoO2, (2) Characterization of the newly synthesized nano- LiMoO2, (3) Construction of cathodes based on the newly synthesized nano-LiMoO2, and (4) Evaluation of the electrochemical properties of the newly synthesized nano-LiMoO2. In the proposed study, established parameters based on the surface area, crystallite size, electrochemical output will be utilized to assess the feasibility of NanoScale's approach. Successful outcome of this project will result in development of new improved lithium ion batteries material to be used in implantable biomedical devices. The incidence of sudden death due to cardiac arrest claims approximataly 460,000 American lives annually. A recent NIH study showed that mortality rate decreases by 23% due to the advances of ICD. Therefore, it is imperative to design and prepare battery material that provides the power outputs to match the current and the next generation life saving implantable medical devices."

DNA molecules made strictly by rational design allows the manufacturer to bypass years of development for the production of efficacious vaccines, and literally create new vaccine entities in days and mass produce vaccines in 2-3 weeks for rapid deployment against new biological agents. However, existing fermentation and purification production technologies are inefficient, difficult to scale, and require sophisticated production equipment and methodology. This limits their utility to meet cost and capacity needs for existing plasmid applications, or to rapidly produce kilograms of plasmid DNA for pandemic vaccination. Phase I addressed these problems directly and successfully by proving feasibility of a cost effective dramatically streamlined and simple purification process that eliminates specialized and costly alkaline or heat lysis steps and the associated toxic waste streams. In Phase II, we will make and evaluate designer strains and associated fermentation and purification methodology. These strains will utilize novel chimeric nucleases and autolytic bacterial strains developed in Phase I. Four prototypes are envisioned. Prototype I is a rapid deployment plasmid production system linking autolytic plasmid purification to Nature Technology Corporation's (NTC) existing fermentation platform to facilitate immediate production of a variety of plasmid DNAs for pandemic applications. The key drivers for this platform are speed of production, safety, simplicity, scalability and transferability to existing manufacturing facilities in developed and emerging countries. Autolytic strains with an integrated chimeric nuclease will be created, and fermentation, autolysis, and plasmid purification methodologies developed. The system will be integrated into NTC's existing rapid deployment DNA vaccine platform (RapidVACC) for response to influenza H5N1 pandemic. Prototypes II-IV are aimed at facilitating the commercialization of gene medicines for a variety of applications. The key drivers for these prototypes are purity, yield, cost (reagents, equipment, volumes, and time), scalability and safety. Prototype IV links high yield defined media fermentation with new simplified lysis and purification methodologies. This technology will be licensed to plasmid DNA manufacturers; one such commercialization channel has already been identified."

Using a variety of modern technologies to study differential gene expression, large numbers of researchers in both academic and industrial settings look for causative effects of activation or repression of particular genes and gene products with respect to the onset and progression of disease. Bioinformatic and computational approaches play a critical role in such studies. NewLink Genetics Corporation is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel drugs and functional genomics solutions with a primary focus on cancer. The company has its own proprietary technology for target gene discovery. To facilitate its in-house bioinformatic analysis, NewLink has licensed software for gene structure prediction from Iowa State University and software for genome-scale sequence matching (""Vmatch"") from Prof. Stefan Kurtz, University of Hamburg, Germany. These programs are key components of NewLink's internal target-discovery bioinformatics pipeline. Vmatch is a versatile string matching application based on enhanced suffix arrays. Recognizing that there are hundreds of other companies with similar bioinformatics needs, NewLink acquired the exclusive distribution and development rights to Vmatch and is now licensing this program to for-profit customers (an academic version of the programs remains freely available to non-profit researchers). This SBIR proposal seeks funds to develop VmatchNL, a GUI driven application of the Vmatch software. The overall goals of our business are to integrate all software into a GUI-driven, industry-quality, comprehensive platform for target gene discovery (""TargetSeqerNL"").

However, deciphering the function(s) of each gene in a high throughput format is complicated by alternative splicing and post- translational modifications of proteins. Serial Analysis of Vector Integration (SAVI(r)) is a patented method for high-throughput acquisition of genome-wide functional exons and gene expression profiling by sequencing only a certain length of each exon boundary as Exon Boundary Tag (EBT) after retroviral gene trapping. Since the EBTs generated will be proportioned to the copy numbers of corresponding mRNA molecules or alternative transcripts, quantification of acquired EBTs can reflect the transcription level for gene expression profiles between different treatments or cell types, such as cancer vs. normal cells, for pharmaceutical developments. Preliminary studies demonstrate the feasibility of generating unique data in this research field with a high potential for functional genome annotation, cDNA collection and exon/splice-specific microarray design.

Seismic data gathered at the surface produces only an ""averaged"" response to the fine scale architecture of many reservoirs.  On the other hand, wireline logs provide high resolution information, but often from vertical boreholes at a spacing greater than the lateral extent of the reservoir.   Because these two forms of information have not been successfully combined to provide a fine-scale rock-composition image, the high sweep efficiencies predicted for alkali-surfactant-polymer  injections, which are greatly influenced by rock-fluid interaction, have not been achieved.  This project will develop a unique method for combining these modalities to simultaneously simulate inter-well lithology and invert seismic reflection data, in order to produce the most probable composite image.  In Phase I, data from Clark County, Arkansas will be used to demonstrate feasibility.  Starting at the borehole and moving out in both directions along the seismic line, probabilistic information will be used to dynamically constrain the spatial composition of the simulation and reflection coefficents of the inversion.  The resulting compositional image will be compared to a nearby outcrop, excluded from the probability development, in order to determine the technique's effectiveness.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The resulting digital rock-composition images, which include both porosity and percent mineral, should find application in the design of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and carbon dioxide sequestering (CDS) projects.

Through the eServe Initiative project, we would determine if it is technologically feasible to capture student management system data, recognize patterns and trends in student data, establish a set of pre-defined decision-making rules, set notification thresholds (individual/group student “alerts”), and then link those to a rich, individually tailored menu of evidence-based classroom instruction and behavior management strategies for educators to access to help guide them in making sound decisions about how best to improve educational outcomes for all students.  These strategies have been demonstrated in the research literature to be highly effective in preventing and reducing exclusionary disciplinary referrals, which often result in students with significant behavior problems losing valuable access to classroom instruction, thus resulting in a higher risk for academic failure."

The company is providing software solutions for the image directed diagnosis and therapy of common pulmonary diseases. There is now a critical need for objective quantitative tools for both assessing lung structure an function as well as guiding novel interventions. With this phase II SBIR, we seek to continue our efforts to combine our parenchymal and airway analysis to plan, guide and evaluate endobronchial-based interventions. The management of pulmonary emphysema and of lung cancer is currently undergoing major change. With emphysema, novel therapy in the form of one-way valves within the bronchial tree, is in clinical trials both in the United States and Europe with multiple companies introducing products. This therapy (referred to as endoscopic lung volume reduction therapy) requires that the valves be placed endoscopically to all of the airways subtending the most severely affected lung lobe. Because of poor patient lung function it is highly desirable that the valve placements be performed efficiently and effectively. This requires substantial pre and intraoperative computer based planning, with analysis and evaluation of the subtending airways, as well as of the emphysematous lung parenchyma. VIDA Diagnostics has utilized a phase 1 SBIR to develop highly relevant software solutions (developing as the Pulmonary Pathfinder) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these procedures, has engaged all of the major companies within this health care space, in maturing and testing the solutions. Additional interest is being shown by other companies in software solutions for stent placement in a compromised airway. Lung cancer has seen a major new interest in early detection through MDCT screening. Early detected lesions are lung nodules, of which only about 3% are malignant. Expensive hardware solutions to facilitate biopsy of these lesions have been developed very recently, including bronchoscopic ultrasound and magnetic tracking devices. VIDA Diagnostics, as part of the effort to provide a road map to the region of lung emphysema, will develop simple software solutions to facilitate lung nodule pathfinding to assist in real time bronchoscopic biopsy procedures. Such visualization tools should add to lung nodule biopsy success rates, and reduce substantially the need for expensive surgical options. VIDA Diagnostics is facilitating bench to bedside evaluation and incorporation of these pulmonary path finding software solutions into clinical practice, and is enjoying substantial across the board encouragement and interest from pulmonologists, supporting companies and from the wider community. Advances in medical imaging and novel, non-surgical therapies for lung disease make it critical to accurately detect, measure, and track lung abnormalities. This project aims to develop methods for identifying lung disease and to help a physician plan non-surgical interventions via the airways. These methods are urgently needed to take advantage of emerging therapies for the early treatment of lung disease."

The overall goal of this project is to enable the pharmaceutical industry to conduct high-throughput screening (HTS) studies with Fa2N-4 cells, a new cell line created by immortalizing human hepatocytes with SV-40 virus, in order to identify those drug candidates that will likely cause clinically significant drug-drug interactions as a result of their ability to induce (up-regulate) the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and other drug-metabolizing/transporting enzymes. Enzyme induction by drugs and other agents (such as herbal agent St. John's Wort) is a serious cause of drug-drug interactions; it is responsible for the loss of therapeutic effect of life-saving drugs (such as anti-HIV, anti-cancer and anti-coagulant drugs) and life- modifying drugs (such as oral contraceptive steroids). The US-FDA now considers enzyme induction to be an obstacle to drug approval (i.e., grounds for disapproval), especially for drugs intended for use in combination with anti-HIV or other drugs used to treat life-threatening diseases. Enzyme induction occurs in a highly species-specific manner, such that studies aimed at assessing clinical outcome must be conducted in a human-based system. Currently, the use of primary cultures of human hepatocytes represents the ""gold standard"" for evaluating enzyme-induction potential in vitro, but this approach is limited by an inadequate (and erratic) supply of non-transplantable human liver. Human-derived hepatic cell lines, such as HepG2 cells, do not respond appropriately to those drugs that cause clinically significant enzyme induction because they lack a functional PXR/CAR signaling pathway. However, this signaling pathway is functional in the new line of immortalized human hepatocytes (Fa2N-4 cells), which suggests that these cells can be used to identify drug candidates as enzyme inducers, which will save millions of dollars in failed drug development costs, as well as improve drug safety by reducing the incidence of drug-drug interactions, which are reported to be one of the leading causes of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), which in turn are one of the leading causes of preventable death in the United States."

An aptamer is a single stranded nucleic acid that acts like an antibody but that can be expressed and function inside cells. The PD173955 RNA aptamer will be selected to lay the groundwork for developing a novel imaging technology that could also be used for enhancing drug therapy. The Concept is that the aptamer, present inside the cell or targeted to the cell surface, could concentrate drug in or around the cell. A radioactive analogue of the drug could be used for imaging. 
The proposed basis of imaging involves accumulation of radiolabeled drug by aptamers. The increased intracellular or pericellular drug concentration in the cell should increase the effectiveness of the drug. However, the kinetic parameters of the aptamer are expected to be very important for optimal imaging and therapeutic enhancement. Therefore, we are developing a computational model that is based on a mathematical rendering of the kinetic and diffusion constants of the aptamer, drug and the enzyme targeted by the drug. Development of the mathematical model will proceed in parallel with the aptarner selection and guide the choice of selection protocols.
The following specific aims are proposed for development of an aptamer to PD173955 for imaging and therapeutic applications: 1) prepare PD173955 linked to a solid support for aptamer selection, 2) select an RNA aptamer that recognizes PD173955, and 3) develop a mathematical model for the use of aptamers in imaging and enhancing drug therapy.
 Phase II The current proposal describes a novel nucleic acid structure based on aptamers that will be expressed in cells to mark them so they can be detected in viva by available imaging technology. We call the markers intracellular Multi-Aptamer Genetic Tags"" (IMAGEtags). The basic innovation in the proposed IMAGEtag design is the expression, in living cells, of aptamers that can be used to track the cells in vivo by a noninvasive procedure. Cells that express IMAGEtags will be detected by virtue of the concentrated radiolabeled ligands that are bound and trapped in the cells by the aptarner components of IMAGEtags. The promoter from which the IMAGEtags are expressed will determine which cells can be imaged. For example, many genes that are responsible for increased proliferation are expressed in cancer cells and not in most normal cells. If these promoters, or a ""synthetic"" promoter that was highly expressed only in cancer cells, were used to drive IMAGEtag expression then cancer cells would be imaged. 
We also propose that the IMAGEtags could also be applied to enhancing drug therapy. Because the mechanism of imaging involves accumulation of ligand, IMAGEtas that recognize a particular drug could draw more drug into the cell and increase the effectiveness of the drug. 
The design and selection of IMAGEtags and their target ligands will be guided by computational modeling to optimize the kinetic characteristics of the aptamers and their ligands for imaging and enhanced therapeutic applications. 
Development of MAGEtags for imaging and therapeutic applications will be achieved by the following specific aims: 1) refine the PD173955 aptamer to function inside cells and prepare cells that stably express the aptamer, 2) refine the mathematical model for in vivo imaging, 3) validate the ability to image with aptamers in vivo using cultured cells, and 4) Use the PD173955 aptamer to image in animals."

The broad, long-term objectives of this Phase I STTR proposal is to demonstrate feasibility in developing a novel optical-electronic biosensor for microscopic applications to permit simultaneous integration of photonic and electronic signals for comprehensive time-lapsed microscopy applications. Optical microscopy has limitations in sensitivity to evaluate the impact of signal transduction on cell-membrane function. Light microscopy is unable to detect cell-membrane displacement at the low nanometer level, and its specificity is limited by the potential over-interpretation of observed microscopic changes at the micron level. Thus, optical signals need to be properly interpreted within the contexts of an independent method. In contrast, electronic sensors have the resolution to measure cell surface cell membrane function at the low nanometer level but have limited intracellular spatial resolution. In collaboration with Iowa State University, CET Inc. will develop a novel, optical-electronic biosensor that will measure several functional parameters in cultured cells in a nondestructive fashion with a resolution of transmission electron microscopy. This sensor will combine the complementary strengths of electronic and optical signals. The outcome of this research is to demonstrate feasibility that will leverage a Phase II proposal that leads to further developments in sensor design, software and hardware development and image analysis and signal processing to provide comprehensive information on signal transduction in cultured living cells. The commercial product will provide a comprehensive platform for cell microscopists. The specific objectives for Phase I of this STTR are: (1) fabricate an optical-electronic sensor that can quantitatively and dynamically measure cell adhesion and motility without electrode signal degradation; (2) experimentally validate that the sensor is not inherently toxic to cells over both short and long time periods; (3) validate that the sensor does not impede the photonic signals from phase, DIC, and fluorescent microscopy."

The need to improve medication management, among the frail elderly, via such technologic innovation as the MD 2 needs to be more formally studied through a randomized clinical trial to establish the benefits of having such a high compliance rate. Such strategies may offer increased support to the elderly with fewer human resources and a substantially reduced cost to the public health system. This needs to be documented through a randomized trial. This STTR Phase I study is to establish protocols and working relationships for a STTR Phase II study of the effectiveness of using an MD 2. The specific aims of this study focus on establishing Data Monitoring protocol, Safety Monitoring protocol, finalizing assessment tools and establishing good working collaborations between Interactive Medical Developments, LC, the University of Iowa Center on Aging and four Area Agencies on Aging."

This project will investigate and develop effective information technologies for comparative analysis and visualization of complex data generated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC). GCxGC is an emerging technology that provides an order-of-magnitude greater separation capacity, significantly better signal-to-noise ratio, and higher dimensional retention-structure relations than traditional GC. The principal challenge for utilization of GCxGC, in a wide range of public-health and other applications, is the difficulty of analyzing and interpreting the large, complex data it generates. The quantity and complexity of GCxGC data necessitates the investigation and development of new information technologies. This project will develop and demonstrate innovative methods and tools for comparative analysis of GCxGC datasets. The expected results of this research and development include a PCA-based method for chemical fingerprinting, decision trees with chemical constraints for sample classification, genetic programming for template and constraint-based matching and classification, and visualization methods for comparative GCxGC analyses. These methods will be implemented in commercial software that will support researchers and laboratory analysts in a wide range of commercial applications, including health care, environmental monitoring, and chemical processing. The power of GCxGC, supported by effective information technologies, will enable better understanding of chemical compositions and processes, a foundation for future scientific advances and discoveries. Relevance to Public Health. Today, a few advanced laboratories are pioneering GCxGC for a variety of applications such as environmental monitoring of exposure profiles in air, soil, food, and water; identification and quantification of toxic products in blood, urine, milk, and breath samples; and qualitative and quantitative metabolomics to provide a holistic view of the biochemical status or biochemical phenotype of an organism. Many analyses in these applications require detailed chemical comparisons of samples, e.g..monitoring changes, comparison to reference standards, chemical matching or ""fingerprinting"", and classification. GCxGC is a powerful new technology for such comparative analyses. This proposal will provide innovative information technologies to support users in these applications."

An aptamer is a single stranded nucleic acid that acts like an antibody but that can be expressed and function inside cells. The PD173955 RNA aptamer will be selected to lay the groundwork for developing a novel imaging technology that could also be used for enhancing drug therapy. The Concept is that the aptamer, present inside the cell or targeted to the cell surface, could concentrate drug in or around the cell. A radioactive analogue of the drug could be used for imaging.    The proposed basis of imaging involves accumulation of radiolabeled drug by aptamers. The increased intracellular or pericellular drug concentration in the cell should increase the effectiveness of the drug. However, the kinetic parameters of the aptamer are expected to be very important for optimal imaging and therapeutic enhancement. Therefore, we are developing a computational model that is based on a mathematical rendering of the kinetic and diffusion constants of the aptamer, drug and the enzyme targeted by the drug. Development of the mathematical model will proceed in parallel with the aptarner selection and guide the choice of selection protocols.    The following specific aims are proposed for development of an aptamer to PD173955 for imaging and therapeutic applications: 1) prepare PD173955 linked to a solid support for aptamer selection, 2) select an RNA aptamer that recognizes PD173955, and 3) develop a mathematical model for the use of aptamers in imaging and enhancing drug therapy.        Phase II        The current proposal describes a novel nucleic acid structure based on aptamers that will be expressed in cells to mark them so they can be detected in viva by available imaging technology. We call the markers intracellular Multi-Aptamer Genetic Tags"" (IMAGEtags). The basic innovation in the proposed IMAGEtag design is the expression, in living cells, of aptamers that can be used to track the cells in vivo by a noninvasive procedure. Cells that express IMAGEtags will be detected by virtue of the concentrated radiolabeled ligands that are bound and trapped in the cells by the aptarner components of IMAGEtags. The promoter from which the IMAGEtags are expressed will determine which cells can be imaged. For example, many genes that are responsible for increased proliferation are expressed in cancer cells and not in most normal cells. If these promoters, or a ""synthetic"" promoter that was highly expressed only in cancer cells, were used to drive IMAGEtag expression then cancer cells would be imaged.    We also propose that the IMAGEtags could also be applied to enhancing drug therapy. Because the mechanism of imaging involves accumulation of ligand, IMAGEtas that recognize a particular drug could draw more drug into the cell and increase the effectiveness of the drug.    The design and selection of IMAGEtags and their target ligands will be guided by computational modeling to optimize the kinetic characteristics of the aptamers and their ligands for imaging and enhanced therapeutic applications.    Development of MAGEtags for imaging and therapeutic applications will be achieved by the following specific aims: 1) refine the PD173955 aptamer to function inside cells and prepare cells that stably express the aptamer, 2) refine the mathematical model for in vivo imaging, 3) validate the ability to image with aptamers in vivo using cultured cells, and 4) Use the PD173955 aptamer to image in animals."

The project's goal will be accomplished by further optimizing the microdisplay device structural design and fabrication process based on the demonstrative results obtained in Phase I. Based on high-efficiency semiconductor micro-light-emitting diode (microLED) array technology, the GaN microdisplay is the first of its kind based on semiconductor LEDs. Specifically, by the hybrid integration of GaN microLED arrays with Si CMOS driver circuits through flip-chip bonding, active matrix addressable GaN microdisplays will have a compact size and will be able to support more information content and movie display due to their high pixel filling factor, uniformity, luminance, and power efficiency. The unique intrinsic properties of GaN microLEDs - high brightness (> 10 microwatt  optical output power for microLEDs of 18 micrometer in diameter), wide viewing angle (~ 160 degrees), fast response time (< 1 ns), and high thermal and vibrational resistance, make GaN microdisplays a perfect solution for environmentally demanding applications such as head-up displays (HUD) in modern vehicles and aircrafts, head-mounted displays (HMD) for firefighters and other rescue operatives, and hand-held mini-projectors for field applications.  Microdisplays have a small size (typically less than 1 inch diagonal) with a resolution from low end to above XVGA format. They are magnified by optics to form enlarged virtual or projected images for viewing by a user. Microdisplays can be used in a variety of devices such as head-mounted displays, video headsets, camcorder viewfinders, projection TV, head-up displays, etc. and have many commercial applications. GaN microdisplay, with its superior performance over other microdisplay technologies, is especially suitable for environmentally demanding applications that require high brightness, high reliability, and wide operating temperature range. With a slight modification of the material composition, GaN microLED arrays developed here can vary the emitted wavelength from the green to the ultraviolet range, which is very suitable for fluorescence analysis used in new type chemical-biology agent detector array or DNA/protein microchips. The GaN microLED array also has the potential for applications such as optical links and parallel computing. Other applications also include spatially resolved optical studies of biological, medical, and health care systems. The research will also enrich the general knowledge of wide bandgap semiconductor micro- and nano-photonics."

Intelligent Tutoring Systems have proven to be highly effective in delivering computer-based instruction, but have historically been expensive and difficult to build, requiring specialized skill in Artificial Intelligence and production systems programming.  This proposal describes a Software Development Kit (SDK) composed of four components:  Cognitive Model Authoring, Problem Authoring,   Tool Authoring, and Curriculum Authoring.  The proposed research activity centers on the first of these components:  Cognitive Model Authoring.  Cognitive Model Authoring is comprised of three separate steps:  defining an object hierarchy, defining the goal structure of the problem task, and representing the behavior of the instructional system.  The proposal is to define an object-oriented visualization of these steps, so that non-cognitive scientists can create cognitive tutors.  This tool will decrease the amount of time it takes to author the cognitive model portion of a tutor for an experienced cognitive modeler, and it also will decrease the amount of time it takes for a new person with no cognitive modeling experience to come up to speed with creating cognitive models.  The Cognitive Tutor SDK will have two impacts: 1) easier production of new Cognitive Tutors, and hence the ability to bring them to market more quickly and 2) development of  a Software  Development  Kit that could be independently marketed, enabling other companies to produce intelligent tutors in other domains, languages, countries and markets.  There are four markets for the Cognitive Tutor SDK: internal developers, external users interested in adapting existing tutor materials for related markets (prisons, welfare-to-work programs), internal and external developers of tutors in related mathematical disciplines, and external developers of tutors in other domains.  The emphasis on accountability in education provides a strong market need for effective instruction, which should help drive the desire for proven technology like Intelligent Tutoring Systems."

Inspection of fastener holes in thick multi-layer structures described in the Topic AF04-134, is a big challenge to all existing or emerging nondestructive inspection (NDI) techniques, including ultrasonic techniques, X-ray, conventional eddy current techniques, super-conductive quanta interface device, etc. Among all ECT’s, the FG RFEC & SSEC is the only technique that has a penetration depth not limited by Skin-Depth, because the signal received by its receiving unit has penetrated through the object wall twice and carries a clean signal about the wall conditions. Therefore, FG RFEC & SSEC is the most promising technique in reaching the goal set in this project topic description. There are three Phase II objectives:  Objective # 1: Detection of cracks on F-15 titanium (Ti) spar structures. Objective # 2: Detection of cracks through aircraft bushings. Objective # 3: Inspection of Titanium Structure through Composite Skin. Coupons and specifications of the above three objectives have been specified by US Air Force Research Laboratory. IMTT will develop and deliver a production prototype system based on the remote field eddy-current technology which is capable of addressing multi-layer crack detection in the three areas listed above – F-15 Ti spar structures, aircraft bushings, and Ti structures through a composite skin.  The system will also be producible, supportable, affordable and transitionable. One commercial system and three commercial probes with advanced and automated functions will be designed, prototyped, and produced with an appropriate industrial partner, such as SAIC and/or Rohmann.  Mr. Sun, Yushi, President of IMTT and Principal Investigator, has more than 19 years of experience in R&D of the FG RFEC & SSEC technique, as well as in finite element modeling of electromagnetic NDI phenomena. He is an active and Founding Member of the International Computation Electromagnetics Society, COMPUMAG, and was a Session Chair and a member of the Editorial Board for a number of international conferences in computational electromagnetics and electromagnetic NDI."

Such analyzers are needed to achieve a better understanding of the global budget of these trace gases and to quantify their exchanges between the atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere.  This project will develop a tunable, diode-laser-based instrument platform using newly-developed laser technology.  The new instrument platform will be applied first to methane analysis using currently available communication lasers.  Phase I will determine the necessary characteristics of the methane sensor, optimize the configuration for the multiple-path optical cell, determine mechanical stability, determine the durability of exposed optics, evaluate a Distributed Feedback laser and a Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting laser, and build a working test platform to verify the design. Commercial Applications and other Benefits as described by the awardee:  The lack of robust and reliable methane analyzers has limited the measurement of methane emission from terrestrial ecosystems to short-period campaigns only, ranging from a few weeks to a couple of months.  With the new instrument platform, measurements can be made year-round with minor maintenance.  The platform should also be adaptable to the analysis of other trace gases and isotopic elements (including ammonia, nitroxide, carbon isotope, and oxygen isotope) when appropriate lasers become available."

Over two-hundred different single DMA molecules would be sequenced simultaneously in a single well (maximum 10 nt/s per molecule) with read lengths 20 kb or more. Sequencing cost is potentially lower with this method compared to other long read approaches because of a high degree of multiplexing and because a simple microtiter plate substitutes for expensive micro or nanofabricated devices. While novel in concept, the proposed ""electrokinetic"" sequencing method would utilize modified polymerases and phosphate-labeled nucleotides from ongoing research on an alternative ""charge-switch"" method of single molecule sequencing.  Ultrabright fluorescent nanoparticles and a prototype two-electrode sequencing chamber will be developed in Phase I. Particle transport kinetics will be characterized using the prototype chamber."

These metal island films have been largely studied for their ability to increase fluorescent intensities in low quantum yield fluorophores, but little information exists on the ability of these metal islands to enhance the performance of fluorescent dyes used in proteomic and genomic applications. Moreover, the effects of metallic surface characteristics on the enhancement of fluorescent dyes have not been systematically studied, and even less is known about the reproducibility and longevity of these metal island films.      The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance fluorescence of near-infrared dyes through the use of metal island films. Fluorescence in the near-infrared offers the additional advantage of significantly lowering the background generated by the visible wavelengths used in currently available array technologies. We will characterize techniques for producing metal island films with respect to reproducibility and longevity. We will also explore metal island geometry that may enhance fluorescence intensity. This work will add to our knowledge of how metallic surfaces can be reproducibly generated and will lay the foundation for a broader understanding of how metal enhanced fluorescence can be used to lower the limit of sample detection. In the long term, the goal of this research will be to develop a microarray slide or substrate that uses metal enhanced fluorescence to decrease the limit of detection while using currently available instrumentation."

Biphasic liquid media strategies are an alternative, but these rely heavily on confinement of the active species in one of the two phases, potentially compromising the frequency of substrate/catalyst molecular encounters.  This project will develop technology for the micro- and/or nano-encapsulation of a liquid-phase core containing the catalytic species inside a porous ¿egg-shell¿ structure.  The capsules will function as micro- or nanoreactors, allowing diffusion of substrates, products and solvents through their porous shells and in and out of their cores, while keeping bulky catalytic species encaged to facilitate subsequent catalyst-product separation steps.  In principle, this should lead to utilization of the oxidation biocatalyst in its most effective (non-immobilized) state, while minimizing the number of  post-reaction separation steps.  Phase I will manufacture and conduct preliminary testing of one core-shell material for partial oxidation catalysis.  The system will be based on a core containing dissolved enzymes and a hybrid (organic/inorganic) porous shell.  Commercial Applications and Other Benefits as described by the awardee:   The technology should maintain the activity and selectivity of the biocatalyst at the highest possible levels while still providing a means for facilitating any potential post-reaction separation step.  Besides the specific catalytic process being targeted, a similar approach should be applicable to asymmetric and enzyme catalysis for fine chemicals synthesis."

The rate of nanotechnology R&D growth in the commercial, academic, and private sectors, appears to be outpaced only by the increasing level of concern among policy makers, Federal agencies, academic researchers and the general public regarding the toxicity of new nanomaterials. We are convinced that our initiative is timely, and that it responds a true societal need.      The proposed business venture is based on a unique set of manufacturing methods to design a wide variety of well-defined nanostructured powders, and a partnership with the Midwest Research Institute is established to integrate toxicology tests with the nanomanufacturing component, and into a business plan involving professionals with diverse backgrounds. The proposed effort also involves participation of Kamterter II, LLC, another Lincoln, NE based small business with an interest in nanotechnology applications for the agrochemical industry. LNKChemsolutions will contribute the know-how for nanomaterials synthesis. The MRI has code-compliant barrier facilities to handle the more toxic samples, and a proven track record of research with animal models. Kamterter II, LLC, provides a platform to target the agrochemical secdtor, who is becoming increasingly more concerned with the formulation, use, and environmental impact of pesticides in their nanoparticulate forms.      Preliminary toxicology tests on three model systems with real commercial potential, and the design of such nanostructured materials, will serve as a platform to launch a spinoff business venture dedicated to serving the health sciences community and the private sector concerned with the environmental and occupational health impact of new nanotechnology products. The three case studies will include nanoparticle synthesis and preliminary toxicological testing of one metal oxide, one pesticide, and one multiactivity phytochemical. On completion of Phase I research, we expect to appeal to a broad clientele for custom synthesis of well-defined and characterized nanomaterials for toxicological evaluation, or for contract research and testing."

The treatment cost for patients suffering from these conditions are massive with an estimated annual economic cost of $65 billion in the US alone. Magnetic resonance imaging facilitates non-invasive imaging of articular cartilage in vivo. However, manual analysis is tedious, inaccurate, and irreproducible and no computer-aided tool is commercially available to analyze high-resolution 3-D MR cartilage image data. This proposal is for development and feasibility assessment of quantitative analysis of articular cartilage in highly congruent joints (knee, hip, ankle) from 3-D magnetic resonance images. The Phase I proposal will demonstrate that identification (segmentation) of the cartilage surfaces can be accomplished highly automatically and with subvoxel accuracy in the most difficult-to-segment region of the joint contact area. The main innovation of the proposed approach is that the multiple surfaces of adjoining bones and cartilages will be segmented simultaneously in 3-D rather than independently border-by-border and slice-by-slice in 2-D, thus taking advantage of 3-D contextual information with an expected improvement in 3-D segmentation performance.        The specific aims of this Phase-l proposal are to:     1) Develop a method for simultaneous multi-surface detection of cartilage and bone surfaces in volumetric high-resolution MR images.     2) Develop a method for automated initialization of such multi-surface segmentation.     3) Assess segmentation errors and demonstrate subvoxel accuracy of the developed methods for cartilage segmentation and cartilage morphology assessment in comparison with existing independent standards.        Once feasibility is demonstrated in the joint contact region, the future Phase II will develop methods for comprehensive analysis of cartilage morphology and cartilage tissue characterization in the entire joint. Therefore, the goal of the continuing Phase II research will be to build and validate a prototype system for quantitative cartilage analysis that will be utilized by orthopedic clinicians treating osteoarthritis, orthopedic surgeons, musculoskeletal radiologists, and researchers for epidemiologic and pharmacologic studies, as well as by MR scanner manufacturers."

The resulting approximately 500 million dollars in lost revenue to producers is a cost ultimately borne by consumers. To minimize damaged eggs, producers have attempted to increase calcium in the ration but have had limited success because the hen's ability to utilize additional calcium is metabolically limited. Feeding vitamin D metabolites to increase calcium deposited in the eggshell has also been tried, but the most effective metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, is currently too expensive for commercial use. This proposal will further develop a naturally occurring metabolite of vitamin D for use in laying hen diets. The metabolite is produced by the plant Solanum glaucophyllum as a vitamin D3-glycoside. This metabolite has the potential to increase the active vitamin D levels in the hen, thus improving calcium metabolism and eggshell strength."
